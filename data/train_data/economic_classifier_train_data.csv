408986117,USA TODAY,2006-07-26,Feature,life,Trees,D.1,1662,Treehouses lovely as a poem ; New designs go out on a whim,"rowe, n.m. -- so where does an intense actor like val kilmer, known for disappearing into emotionally toxic roles such as jim morrison, go to find himself?the answer is found up a steep embankment of loose shale that snakes alongside the lazy pecos river. there, five oak trees embrace a cocoon of wood and tin, one artist's rendition of that most iconic of childhood getaways: the treehouse.""i'll fib and say it's for my kids, but it's really for me,"" says kilmer, 46, flashing that famous army of white teeth, his blond locks  buzzed for his just-wrapped role in the upcoming cbs miniseries comanche moon. ""i had a treehouse as a child. so being an adult  ... well, it's strangely, weirdly satisfying to sit in a tree.""it doesn't hurt that kilmer's trees sit on a 6,000-acre ranch so remote that one of his nearest neighbors, jane fonda, is a long hawk's flight away. but such epic real estate isn't required to experience the escapist magic  of communing with birds' nests.from funky new york gardens to manicured california backyards, the treehouse is newly in vogue as homeowners seek to either reclaim their youth or provide children with at-home fun. or both. and while a dad with a hammer  can  do the job, many are calling on a small number of specialized builders who give the tree its say and can charge lofty sums for the privilege.what's workable is whatever is imaginable. while some treehouses remain little more than airy clubhouses in the clouds, others boast beds, crown molding, fireplaces and just about any other comfort from shelters  on terra firma. the add-on that's added up.""two reasons treehouses have become more popular,"" says roderick romero, a new york   treehouse builder to the stars, including kilmer.

""that tree was perfect the way it was. it wasn't asking for a house in it,"" he says.but about 30 yards away, a stand of five oaks clung bravely to an almost sheer rock face. romero imagined a ""little house that would look like it had fallen from the mesa above and gotten stuck in these five trees."" kilmer loved the idea.wood for the project was sourced from a decaying 100-year-old barn, metal from local salvage yards.  ""i want to do everything here in an ecologically friendly way,"" says kilmer, who eight years ago purchased this spread, once owned by actress greer garson.kilmer eventually will ""build a new house here by the river, have some organic gardens to farm what i need and just get back to the land. in a way, this treehouse is my first step in that direction.""kilmer has lived in the wilds of northern new mexico for 20 years, going back to his breakthrough role in top gun (1986). he even got married in the area, to now ex-wife joanne whalley.the couple's two children, mercedes, 14, and jack, 11, live with their actress mother in l.a. kilmer clearly delights in them; the dash  of his beat-up land rover sports an array of graffiti, including ""jack rocks"" and ""mercedes rules.""he hopes the treehouse will be a magnet for their attention.""they haven't seen this place yet, but i can't wait,"" says kilmer, lying on the treehouse deck in shorts and a sweat-soaked khaki shirt. ""my son's a monkey. he'll be up on that tin roof in no time.""if dad doesn't get there first, that is. though the structure has been up only a few weeks, kilmer has bonded with it. he credits both an inherent familial connection -- a distant cousin, poet joyce kilmer, is famous for his poem trees -- and a need to decompress.

""there's a sense of freedom and wonderment up here.""a fast-moving afternoon storm starts to lay siege. within minutes, rain drops are pounding the treehouse's tin roof while lightning zigzags ominously nearby. and kilmer is going exactly nowhere.""in places like this,"" he says, ""i can figure out what i'm all about.""tips for would-be buildersso you have a tree. but are you a candidate for a treehouse?treehouse designer and builder roderick romero says people who consider this sylvan architectural adventure should keep in mind:*tree type.

""so we treated it as a totally new house, basically.""the woffords' house is among the show's more extreme projects, according to building permits and tax assessment records reviewed by usa today. in los angeles county, the show's work on a house owned by rodney and kristen powers pushed its assessed value up $42,000. work on a house owned by trent and dawna woslum brought a $19,000 increase. property tax for both probably will increase by several hundred dollars.""we're very upfront with the families in telling them that there's a likelihood that the value of the house will increase, and therefore there will be a resulting property tax increase,"" says david goldberg, president of show producer endemol usa. ""but we see that as a worthwhile tradeoff for receiving a new home, and i can't tell you how many letters i've received from families saying, 'you changed my life.' ""but how about income taxes on all the appliances, toys and building materials people get? goldberg says the show pays each family $50,000 to rent its house for 10 days, and it relies on federal tax rules that say income on rentals of less than 15 days is non-taxable. the producers also believe that any improvements they make to the house while renting it also are non-taxable.""we consulted not one but many, many experts in the field,"" goldberg says of the solution, which saves families tens of thousands of dollars.but others are skeptical. ""we feel that is an argument that will not fly with the irs,"" says jackie perlman, a tax researcher with h&r block. ""we go by intent, and the (show) is not there as renters, they are there to renovate.""an irs spokeswoman had no comment.goldberg also downplays concerns about whether the families -- which abc often describes as struggling to make ends meet -- can make their higher tax bills, not to mention increased utility bills.""endemol as well as abc takes the welfare of each family seriously, and if it becomes a real problem we'll discuss the situation with them,"" he says. ""the goal of this show is to help people.""several extreme makeover families usa today interviewed declined to discuss their financial situations, but all were ecstatic about their new houses.""it was a tremendous, positive change,"" says contessa mendoza, a single mother whose van nuys, calif., home was rebuilt by the show this year.

1027415041,USA TODAY,2012-07-23,News,life,Actors,D.3,772,Big success of 'Downton' has PBS looking up,"if pbs is hot these days, it's thanks to the glow of downton abbey.having won a slew of awards last year, including an emmy for best miniseries, the show has been nominated for 16 emmys in the series category this season, making it the most honored non-american series ever.how do the actors feel about that? ""gobsmacked. i don't know whether it translates. overwhelmed,"" says hugh bonneville, who plays lord crawley in the british period drama. ""to have the show embraced so wholeheartedly from america is a great thrill for all of us.""downton returns in january for a third season, and ""this season,"" says creator julian fellowes, ""in a way is about the recovery from (world war i).  that's really the kind of theme of the season. there are chills and thrills involved for all the characters.""and this year joining those characters is cora's (elizabeth mcgovern) american mother -- played by shirley maclaine, who said sharing a news conference saturday with the other actors was like ""being back with my family. it was an extraordinary experience for me, also for stamina and work ethic. we were shooting outside in the wind and the rain with our formal gear on and nobody seemed to notice, so i quickly stepped in there and acted like i didn't notice, either.""with the war  behind it, downton is entering the 1920s -- and that, says fellowes, is where it will stay; he has no interest to push forward to the '30s. ""the '20s are a far more nebulous time,"" he says. ""i think it's rather fun to be journeying through that stuff. (i) think we'll be moving fairly slowly.""a new 'neighborhood'a new generation of neighbors is moving into mister rogers' neighborhood. premiering sept. 3, daniel tiger's neighborhood is an animated extension of the late fred rogers' beloved pbs classic.the star in this new half-hour weekday series, aimed at children ages 2 to 4, is daniel tiger, 4-year-old son of daniel striped tiger, rogers' first puppet. he and his friends, all sons and daughters of rogers' original puppet characters, go through adventures and sing songs meant to teach social skills.produced by the fred rogers company, the show arrives with the cooperation and blessing of rogers' widow, joanne rogers. ""my feeling is he would really be pleased with this,"" she says.unlike the original show, which was built around rogers as our guide to the land of make believe, daniel is led by an animated tiger cub. joanne rogers had originally hoped to find a human host to step into her husband's tennis shoes, but, she says, ""there is nobody else. it really is as simple as that. fred didn't spend much time worrying about that when he was alive, because he thought there were people who might be possibilities. but it just didn't work.""and while the old neighborhood used puppets instead of cartoons, that's not because fred rogers was opposed to animation, she says. ""he looked into it. it just never happened. he liked the idea of having some animation.""burns visits 'dust bowl'in his national parks series, ken burns chronicled the natural beauty of our land. next, the historian-director serves up a  slice of its potential for horror.the dust bowl, a two-part film airing on pbs nov. 18-19, is an oral history of the devastating storms that struck the southwest in the 1930s, spawned by a deadly combination of overfarming and drought.  he calls it a ""cautionary tale.""""this is the story of the greatest man-made ecological disaster in american history, a 10-year apocalypse,"" he says. and hitting at the height of the great depression, he says, left ""an epic of human pain and suffering.""the storms swept across oklahoma, colorado and the rest of the southwest, where there could be miles between houses. the residents had never seen anything like it. ""the isolation was so complete,  you can imagine what it would be like for one of these mountain ranges coming toward you and not knowing what it was,"" he says. many of them thought it was the end of the world.

2108734278,USA TODAY,2018-09-19,News,life,Bans,D.2,590,Stars sprint in and then sneak out,"think you know everything that happened during monday night's emmy awards? think again. here are five things you definitely didn't see on tv.on the way into the showeven stars have to deal with bottle-necked entry points at the emmys. we spotted keri russell and matthew rhys snaking their way through a clogged pathway just minutes before the show started.stuck in the same situation, ""glow"" star alison brie made the best of it, taking selfies with fans. ""where's dave?"" a male fan shouted, ostensibly meaning brie's husband, dave franco. ""out of town!"" brie replied.those stars trying to make the curtain call weren't alone: we saw darren criss sprint down a long corridor - in his tux, no less - to make his seat in time for the opening monologue.sometimes a gal needs to ditch her shoeshey, long awards shows aren't for everybody. after laurie metcalf took several ""roseanne"" jokes on the chin during the opening monologue, she lost the  supporting actress race to ""the marvelous mrs. maisel's"" alex borstein. but metcalf didn't seem too upset after the loss. she got to exit the awards show early with her daughter - and ditched her white heels while she was at it. we spotted the future ""conners"" star slipping her stilettos off in the bar area.stars refueled midshowthis is not a short show. the bar area (where everything from nachos to popcorn and champagne was served) was in full swing during the ceremony, especially during commercial breaks. we spotted ""grown-ish"" star yara shahidi buying a wetzel's pretzel for her younger brother midshow and netflix exec ted sarandos purchasing a hot dog toward the tail end.this was the first year alcohol (including a $14 blood orange margarita) and assorted beverages were allowed inside the auditorium - to many attendees' delight. and in the bathrooms, an extra perk: stars could retouch their makeup with free l'oreal mascara and lipstick. not too shabby.an epic proposalyou caught the epic, midshow proposal, right? well, not everyone in the microsoft theater did. since no tvs are present in the bar area, during the surprise segment in which director glenn weiss proposed to his girlfriend, jan svendsen, on live tv, the bustling bar area was completely unaware.

2825988423,USA TODAY,2023-06-16,News,business,Parents & parentingPSYCHOLOGY,B.8,945,Best tech tips to reduce summer brain drain in kids,"as a mom, it drives me nuts to walk inside on a gorgeous day and see kids stuck on the couch with their noses buried in a screen. with all things tech and growing up these days, balance is key. kids need to spend time outside, playing, socializing, exploring the real world and relaxing. not worrying about schoolwork. it's also really important for parents to set and enforce boundaries around tech for kids, even when it's not fun or easy, explained catherine teitelbaum, a former teacher, and principal at amazon family trust.school might be out for the summer, but that doesn't mean all the stuff your kids learned during the last academic year needs to take a one-way trip to neverland. parents, you know what i'm talking about; that ole' ""summer slide,"" ""skill-slippage ""or so-called ""brain drain."" no matter how what you call it, the fact is it's a major concern for many parents and educators alike.a study published in the american educational research journal in 2020 found that students lost, on average, about 20% of their school-year gains in reading and 27% of their school-year gains in math during summertime. a recent harris poll commissioned by educational software company justsystems underscored those results as well, showing some 91% of elementary school parents in the u.s. want their kids to continue learning over the summer months.the last thing many of us parents want to do over our summer break too is nag, cajole or bribe our kids into doing homework when we all just want to relax and have fun. the good news is there are several new tech tools that can help everyone out – without getting kids stuck on screens.do tablets help kids learn?for millions of kids, a tablet is one of the first devices they use to explore the digital world, but it can be a real double-edged sword too. i've seen kids as young as 2 so sucked in and tuned out watching baby shark on an ipad – they don't realize there's a pair of insanely cute puppies and an entire cream cake sitting right next to them. try to pry it out of their sweaty little palms, and they throw a full-blown hissy fit. it's sad.here's the thing: rather than just hand them your shared adult ipad and hope for the best, invest $200 or less on a tablet built from the wires up just for kids.what should i look for in a kid's tablet?for elementary ages and preteens, you want to consider the overall value of the gadget for the price.battery life: some models over up to 10 hours of battery life. don't consider tdels with fewer than eight hours of battery life.extras: consider what else you get for the price, whether a sturdy case, two-year guarantee and free suite of parental controls or free subscriptions that can provide age-appropriate, kid-focused content without ads, access to social media or adult sites.can i share my ipad with my child instead?ipads are expensive. kids are clumsy. also, when you share an adult tablet with your child, it's a huge hassle to try to set up parental controls that you can easily toggle on and off as you hand it back and forth. for many popular tablet models, you need to pay for a third-party app to go between what grown-ups can access versus what kids can see, do and watch.i talk a lot about training wheel tech. just like you teach your child to ride a bike or swim or eventually drive a car – you don't just toss them into the deep end or hand them the keys and expect it to all go perfectly.it's the same with tech. you have to start with the basics, teach and guide them, then take off the floaties, training wheels and ""student driver"" placard as they mature, grow and get more capable of self-regulation.what are the disadvantages of using technology for kids' education?as a mom, it drives me nuts to walk inside on a gorgeous day and see kids stuck on the couch with their noses buried in a screen. with all things tech and growing up these days, balance is key. kids need to spend time outside, playing, socializing, exploring the real world and relaxing. not worrying about schoolwork.it's also really important for parents to set and enforce boundaries around tech for kids, even when it's not fun or easy, explained catherine teitelbaum, a former teacher, and principal at amazon family trust.""while kids don't like rules around tech, they do value them. it makes them feel safe and connected like your parents are looking out for you and thinking through and making informed decisions,"" she added.tech tools for learning should be so much fun that kids don't even realize you snuck in ""school."" before you know it, we could all be talking about the good ole' summer ""brain gain"" too.the views and opinions expressed in this column are the author's and do not necessarily reflect those of usa today.as a mom, it drives me nuts to walk inside on a gorgeous

published in the american educational research journal in 2020 found that students lost on average about 20 of their school year gains in reading and 27 of their school year gains in math during summertime a recent harris poll commissioned by educational software company justsystems underscored those results as well showing some 91 of elementary school parents in the u s want their kids to continue learning over the summer months the last thing many of us parents want to do over our summer break too is nag cajole or bribe our kids into doing homework when we all just want to relax and have fun the good news is there are several new tech tools that can help everyone out without getting kids stuck on screens do tablets help kids learn for millions of kids a tablet is one of the first devices they use to explore the digital world but it can be a real double edged sword too i ve seen kids as young as 2 so sucked in and tuned out watching baby shark on an ipad they don t realize there s a pair of insanely cute puppies and an entire cream cake sitting right next to them try to pry it out of their sweaty little palms and they throw a full blown hissy fit it s sad here s the thing rather than just hand them your shared adult ipad and hope for the best invest 200 or less on a tablet built from the wires up just for kids what should i look for in a kid s tablet for elementary ages and preteens you want to consider the overall value of the gadget for the price battery life some models over up to 10 hours of battery life don t consider tdels with fewer than eight hours of battery life extras consider what else you get for the price whether a sturdy case two year guarantee and free suite of parental controls or free subscriptions that can provide age appropriate kid focused content without ads access to social media or adult sites can i share my ipad with my child instead ipads are expensive kids are clumsy also when you share an adult tablet with your child it s a huge hassle to try to set up parental controls that you can easily toggle on and off as you hand it back and forth for many popular tablet models you need to pay for a third party app to go between what grown ups can access versus what kids can see do and watch i talk a lot about training wheel tech just like you teach your child to ride a bike or swim or eventually drive a car you don t just toss them into the deep end or hand them the keys and expect it to all go perfectly it s the same with tech you have to start with the basics teach and guide them then take off the floaties training wheels and student driver placard as they mature grow and get more capable of self regulation what are the disadvantages of using technology for kids education as a mom it drives me nuts to walk inside on a gorgeous day and see kids stuck on the couch with their noses buried in a screen with all things tech and growing up these days balance is key kids need to spend time outside playing socializing exploring the real world and relaxing not worrying about schoolwork it s also really important for parents to set and enforce boundaries around tech for kids even when it s not fun or easy explained catherine teitelbaum a former teacher and principal at amazon family trust while kids don t like rules around tech they do value them it makes them feel safe and connected like your parents are looking out for you and thinking through and making informed decisions she added tech tools for learning should be so much fun that kids don t even realize you snuck in school before you

409011454,USA TODAY,2007-07-06,News,money,Investment policy,B.6,833,S& P 500 could still be a bargain ; Global factors favor index of large stocks,"if you're looking for a place to invest the stock portion of your retirement portfolio in the coming months, your best bet could well be a fund that tracks the standard & poor's 500-stock index.large-company stocks are still reasonably cheap, mildly out of favor and a solid beneficiary of a vibrant world economy.index funds are about as plain-vanilla an investment as you can get. they throw out the fund manager and just try to mirror the results of a stock index. because they aren't actively managed, they can limit expenses to a bare minimum. those low costs let you keep more money in your account.you can buy index funds that invest in large companies, small companies and everything in between. but large-company index funds, such as those that track the s&p 500 or the russell 1000, are particularly compelling now, even though the s&p 500 has gained a stronger-than-average 7% this year, assuming dividends were reinvested. here are three reasons to move part of your 401(k) to a large-cap index fund now:*price. the s&p 500 index now sells for about 16  times its estimated 2007 earnings -- about its long-term average. (the price- earnings ratio shows how cheap a stock is, relative to earnings. the lower the p-e, the cheaper the stock or stock index.) by contrast, the s&p smallcap 600 index has a considerably higher p-e: about 19.7 times its estimated 2007 earnings.bargain-hunter wallace weitz, manager of weitz partners fund, notes that many stocks that were darlings of the 1990s bull market are still languishing. case in point: wal-mart, the retail giant that is selling for about the same price that it did eight years ago. in the meantime, its earnings have more than doubled. ""i'd say it was overvalued then, but it's undervalued now,"" weitz says.in addition, the forces that have driven up small-company stocks might not last. small companies have been the darlings of wall street since about 2000, when the bull market in large-company stocks turned into an epic bear market. after seven years, though, the surge in small-cap stocks is starting to look a bit old, says larry puglia, manager of t. rowe price blue chip growth fund.""it's a longer cycle than we typically see,"" puglia says.one reason for the longevity of the bull market for small-cap stocks: a flurry of buyouts, particularly from private-equity firms, has kept small-company stock prices rising. but if the buyout boom falters, small-company stocks could falter.*momentum. it's a curious fact that on wall street, as in physics, objects in motion tend to continue in motion. recently, large-company stocks have picked up a bit of steam. the s&p 500, for example, outperformed its comparable small-cap and midcap indexes in the second quarter.*globalization. ""we're seeing strong economic growth in europe and asia, and the s&p 500 companies are getting about 45% of their sales there,"" says alec young, equity analyst for s&p. the boom in sales abroad, young says, made up for any weakness in the u.s. market in the first half of the year.strong overseas sales boost corporate earnings, and so does the dollar's fall on international currency markets. example: say a company earned 1 million euros 12 months ago. at $1.28 per euro, that equals nearly $1.3 million. but a euro is now worth $1.36. so 1 million euros in overseas earnings now equals nearly $1.4 million.large-caps could also fare well if investors sense an economic slowdown. typically, investors flee to large-caps when the financial world seems uncertain.finally, while any rise in interest rates will hurt stocks of any size, it will hurt small-company stocks the most. that's because small companies are most dependent on borrowing to fuel growth. larger companies can typically manage their borrowing and spending to reduce the ill effects of higher rates.because the s&p 500 closely mirrors the performance of large- company stocks, an s&p 500 index fund is a logical place to put the stock portion of your 401(k) money now. because of their low expenses, these funds have outperformed the average managed fund over the long term.if you don't want to miss out on any lingering small-cap rallies, there's another option, too: an index fund that mirrors the total stock market.these funds typically mirror a very broad index, such as the russell 3000 or the s&p 1500 supercomposite. they're weighted by capitalization -- market price multiplied by number of shares outstanding -- so you'll still own a big dose of large-cap stocks. (large-company stocks make up about 87% of the s&p 1500, young says.) yet you'll also enjoy a boost if small-company stocks continue to soar.graphic, b/w, adrienne lewis, usa today, source: ibbotson & associates; graphics, b/w, source: lipper (chart) (5)",Standard & Poors Corp,1.0,if you re looking for a place to invest the stock portion of your retirement portfolio in the coming months your best bet could well be a fund that tracks the standard poor s 500 stock index large company stocks are still reasonably cheap mildly out of favor and a solid beneficiary of a vibrant world economy index funds are about as plain vanilla an investment as you can get they throw out the fund manager and just try to mirror the results of a stock index because they aren t actively managed they can limit expenses to a bare minimum those low costs let you keep more money in your account you can buy index funds that invest in large companies small companies and everything in between but large company index funds such as those that track the s p 500 or the russell 1000 are particularly compelling now even though the s p 500 has gained a stronger than average 7 this year assuming dividends were reinvested here are three reasons to move part of your 401 k to a large cap index fund now price the s p 500 index now sells for about 16 times its estimated 2007 earnings about its long term average the price earnings ratio shows how cheap a stock is relative to earnings the lower the p e the cheaper the stock or stock index by contrast the s p smallcap 600 index has a considerably higher p e about 19 7 times its estimated 2007 earnings bargain hunter wallace weitz manager of weitz partners fund notes that many stocks that were darlings of the 1990s bull market are still languishing case in point wal mart the retail giant that is selling for about the same price that it did eight years ago in the meantime its earnings have more than doubled i d say it was overvalued then but it s undervalued now weitz says in addition the forces that have driven up small company stocks might not last small companies have been the darlings of wall street since about 2000 when the bull market in large company stocks turned into an epic bear market after seven years though the surge in small cap stocks is starting to look a bit old says larry puglia manager of t rowe price blue chip growth fund it s a longer cycle than we typically see puglia says one reason for the longevity of the bull market for small cap stocks a flurry of buyouts particularly from private equity firms has kept small company stock prices rising but if the buyout boom falters small company stocks could falter momentum it s a curious fact that on wall street as in physics objects in motion tend to continue in motion recently large company stocks have picked up a bit of steam the s p 500 for example outperformed its comparable small cap and midcap indexes in the second quarter globalization we re seeing strong economic growth in europe and asia and the s p 500 companies are getting about 45 of their sales there says alec young equity analyst for s p the boom in sales abroad young says made up for any weakness in the u s market in the first half of the year strong overseas sales boost corporate earnings and so does the dollar s fall on international currency markets example say a company earned 1 million euros 12 months ago at 1 28 per euro that equals nearly 1 3 million but a euro is now worth 1 36 so 1 million euros in overseas earnings now equals nearly 1 4 million large caps could also fare well if investors sense an economic slowdown typically investors flee to large caps when the financial world seems uncertain finally while any rise in interest rates will hurt stocks of any size it will hurt small company stocks the most that s because small companies are most dependent on borrowing to fuel growth larger companies can typically manage their borrowing and spending to reduce the ill effects of higher rates because the s p 500 closely mirrors the performance of large company stocks an s p 500 index fund is a logical place to put the stock portion of your 401 k money now because of their low expenses these funds have outperformed the average managed fund over the long term if you don t want to miss out on any lingering small cap rallies there s another option too an index fund that mirrors the total stock market these funds typically mirror a very broad index such as the russell 3000 or the s p 1500 supercomposite they re weighted by capitalization market price multiplied by number of shares outstanding so you ll still own a big dose of large cap stocks large company stocks make up about 87 of the s p 1500 young says yet you ll also enjoy a boost if small company stocks continue to soar graphic b w adrienne lewis usa today source ibbotson associates graphics b w source lipper chart 5

408986117,USA TODAY,2006-07-26,Feature,life,Trees,D.1,1662,Treehouses lovely as a poem ; New designs go out on a whim,"rowe, n.m. -- so where does an intense actor like val kilmer, known for disappearing into emotionally toxic roles such as jim morrison, go to find himself?the answer is found up a steep embankment of loose shale that snakes alongside the lazy pecos river. there, five oak trees embrace a cocoon of wood and tin, one artist's rendition of that most iconic of childhood getaways: the treehouse.""i'll fib and say it's for my kids, but it's really for me,"" says kilmer, 46, flashing that famous army of white teeth, his blond locks  buzzed for his just-wrapped role in the upcoming cbs miniseries comanche moon. ""i had a treehouse as a child. so being an adult  ... well, it's strangely, weirdly satisfying to sit in a tree.""it doesn't hurt that kilmer's trees sit on a 6,000-acre ranch so remote that one of his nearest neighbors, jane fonda, is a long hawk's flight away. but such epic real estate isn't required to experience the escapist magic  of communing with birds' nests.from funky new york gardens to manicured california backyards, the treehouse is newly in vogue as homeowners seek to either reclaim their youth or provide children with at-home fun. or both. and while a dad with a hammer  can  do the job, many are calling on a small number of specialized builders who give the tree its say and can charge lofty sums for the privilege.what's workable is whatever is imaginable. while some treehouses remain little more than airy clubhouses in the clouds, others boast beds, crown molding, fireplaces and just about any other comfort from shelters  on terra firma. the add-on that's added up.""two reasons treehouses have become more popular,"" says roderick romero, a new york   treehouse builder to the stars, including kilmer. ""first, they provide wonderful relief in these fast-paced, stressed-out times, and second, the structures themselves can now be built very safe, so they'll support all ages and last nearly forever.""specifically, the development of a steel support called the garnier limb, or gl, lets trees bear weights far beyond what they could without the device, allowing for veritable mini-mansions to sprout from backyard trees.the considerable cost of building in trees means it's largely the rich and famous who are pushing the genre's envelope. many of them have come to romero. his eclectic essence -- he's a fully tattooed yoga fanatic with two braids that reach his waist -- has endeared him to the likes of sting, donna karan and julianne moore, for whom he has built treehouses in italy, long island and manhattan, respectively.romero discreetly says his fee ""varies,"" but his creations were trumpeted last year as one of the  neiman marcus christmas catalog's fantasy gifts, priced at $50,000 or more. emphasis on more.while romero's work so far largely has appealed to kids in adult bodies, san francisco-based treehouse builder barbara butler  is on a mission  ""to get kids out of the house and away from air conditioning, carpeting and computers.""though  known for fanciful ground-based play structures that can exceed $200,000, her  passion is  putting children  up high  in trees.""growing up, i'd be gone all day and home by dark,"" she says. ""today, the world's different.  so if the family yard is where time is spent now, why not help make those encounters come to life  in a treehouse that's both artistic and sturdy?""meg burnham of santa barbara has just hired butler to help get her young grandkids  off the ground on her 187-acre estate. ""we're thinking of having  a ship in one tree with a rope ladder that will lead to  the next one,""  she says.scurrying up trunks is in our genes, dating to the days when early humans sought to escape predators that couldn't climb, says david greenberg, curator of treehouses in paradise, a playful exhibit of 100 treehouse designs  that runs through july 31 at the pacific design center in los angeles.""what you see is that this treehouse fantasy is something the whole world relates to,"" says greenberg, whose own projects have been built as far away as china. ""women may see trees as romantic, while guys sometimes do the tarzan thing. but we all connect with them in some way.""evidence of that can be found in treehouses of the world by pete nelson,  a partner in the seattle-based construction firm treehouse workshop. nelson's book showcases such madcap designs  as the ewok treehouse in oxfordshire, england. (think star wars meets edward scissorhands.)""some folks ask for kitchens and bathrooms, but at that point i start to lose some interest, because you're moving away from what the treehouse is all about,"" says nelson, whose projects average $80,000 for 200 square feet, some insulation and a few electrical outlets. ""but this is definitely gaining momentum.""  revenue at treehouse workshop has increased by 20% a year during the past three years.""we're  seeing more builders at our seminars and getting more photos each week"" from people showing off their backyard babies.although clients often have elaborate ideas, experienced  builders say it's important to let mother nature do some of the talking.""the  key  is to come to the land without any preconceived ideas,"" romero says. ""you want to see what the trees tell you to build.""that certainly was the approach kilmer wanted romero to take when he arrived here in early july.initially a lone ponderosa pine beckoned, but romero was concerned both for his own safety -- the house would have sat some 40 feet above the river -- and natural aesthetics. ""that tree was perfect the way it was. it wasn't asking for a house in it,"" he says.but about 30 yards away, a stand of five oaks clung bravely to an almost sheer rock face. romero imagined a ""little house that would look like it had fallen from the mesa above and gotten stuck in these five trees."" kilmer loved the idea.wood for the project was sourced from a decaying 100-year-old barn, metal from local salvage yards.  ""i want to do everything here in an ecologically friendly way,"" says kilmer, who eight years ago purchased this spread, once owned by actress greer garson.kilmer eventually will ""build a new house here by the river, have some organic gardens to farm what i need and just get back to the land. in a way, this treehouse is my first step in that direction.""kilmer has lived in the wilds of northern new mexico for 20 years, going back to his breakthrough role in top gun (1986). he even got married in the area, to now ex-wife joanne whalley.the couple's two children, mercedes, 14, and jack, 11, live with their actress mother in l.a. kilmer clearly delights in them; the dash  of his beat-up land rover sports an array of graffiti, including ""jack rocks"" and ""mercedes rules.""he hopes the treehouse will be a magnet for their attention.""they haven't seen this place yet, but i can't wait,"" says kilmer, lying on the treehouse deck in shorts and a sweat-soaked khaki shirt. ""my son's a monkey. he'll be up on that tin roof in no time.""if dad doesn't get there first, that is. though the structure has been up only a few weeks, kilmer has bonded with it. he credits both an inherent familial connection -- a distant cousin, poet joyce kilmer, is famous for his poem trees -- and a need to decompress. ""my business is very self-oriented and takes enormous energy, so any chance to truly get away is welcome.""kilmer talks mostly in sentence fragments,  a shifting cadence that's  in sync with life's whimsical pace here.  the horses whinny and dart, only to suddenly stand still in a patch of shade. the river mostly glides though canyons etched eons ago, but occasionally accelerates over rocks in a rapid rush.and up in a treehouse sits not a movie star, but a man momentarily whisked back to childhood.put another way: kilmer could live in the grandest of mansions, yet he seems more at home in a  300-square-foot platform in the sky.""look at this tree. it's so solid and yet so fragile that it moves with the wind,"" he says, grasping one of the oaks. ""there's a sense of freedom and wonderment up here.""a fast-moving afternoon storm starts to lay siege. within minutes, rain drops are pounding the treehouse's tin roof while lightning zigzags ominously nearby. and kilmer is going exactly nowhere.""in places like this,"" he says, ""i can figure out what i'm all about.""tips for would-be buildersso you have a tree. but are you a candidate for a treehouse?treehouse designer and builder roderick romero says people who consider this sylvan architectural adventure should keep in mind:*tree type.

1027415041,USA TODAY,2012-07-23,News,life,Actors,D.3,772,Big success of 'Downton' has PBS looking up,"if pbs is hot these days, it's thanks to the glow of downton abbey.having won a slew of awards last year, including an emmy for best miniseries, the show has been nominated for 16 emmys in the series category this season, making it the most honored non-american series ever.how do the actors feel about that? ""gobsmacked. i don't know whether it translates. overwhelmed,"" says hugh bonneville, who plays lord crawley in the british period drama. ""to have the show embraced so wholeheartedly from america is a great thrill for all of us.""downton returns in january for a third season, and ""this season,"" says creator julian fellowes, ""in a way is about the recovery from (world war i).  that's really the kind of theme of the season. there are chills and thrills involved for all the characters.""and this year joining those characters is cora's (elizabeth mcgovern) american mother -- played by shirley maclaine, who said sharing a news conference saturday with the other actors was like ""being back with my family. it was an extraordinary experience for me, also for stamina and work ethic. we were shooting outside in the wind and the rain with our formal gear on and nobody seemed to notice, so i quickly stepped in there and acted like i didn't notice, either.""with the war  behind it, downton is entering the 1920s -- and that, says fellowes, is where it will stay; he has no interest to push forward to the '30s. ""the '20s are a far more nebulous time,"" he says. ""i think it's rather fun to be journeying through that stuff.

""my feeling is he would really be pleased with this,"" she says.unlike the original show, which was built around rogers as our guide to the land of make believe, daniel is led by an animated tiger cub. joanne rogers had originally hoped to find a human host to step into her husband's tennis shoes, but, she says, ""there is nobody else. it really is as simple as that. fred didn't spend much time worrying about that when he was alive, because he thought there were people who might be possibilities. but it just didn't work.""and while the old neighborhood used puppets instead of cartoons, that's not because fred rogers was opposed to animation, she says.

409011454,USA TODAY,2007-07-06,News,money,Investment policy,B.6,833,S& P 500 could still be a bargain ; Global factors favor index of large stocks,"if you're looking for a place to invest the stock portion of your retirement portfolio in the coming months, your best bet could well be a fund that tracks the standard & poor's 500-stock index.large-company stocks are still reasonably cheap, mildly out of favor and a solid beneficiary of a vibrant world economy.index funds are about as plain-vanilla an investment as you can get. they throw out the fund manager and just try to mirror the results of a stock index. because they aren't actively managed, they can limit expenses to a bare minimum. those low costs let you keep more money in your account.you can buy index funds that invest in large companies, small companies and everything in between. but large-company index funds, such as those that track the s&p 500 or the russell 1000, are particularly compelling now, even though the s&p 500 has gained a stronger-than-average 7% this year, assuming dividends were reinvested. here are three reasons to move part of your 401(k) to a large-cap index fund now:*price. the s&p 500 index now sells for about 16  times its estimated 2007 earnings -- about its long-term average. (the price- earnings ratio shows how cheap a stock is, relative to earnings. the lower the p-e, the cheaper the stock or stock index.) by contrast, the s&p smallcap 600 index has a considerably higher p-e: about 19.7 times its estimated 2007 earnings.bargain-hunter wallace weitz, manager of weitz partners fund, notes that many stocks that were darlings of the 1990s bull market are still languishing. case in point: wal-mart, the retail giant that is selling for about the same price that it did eight years ago. in the meantime, its earnings have more than doubled. ""i'd say it was overvalued then, but it's undervalued now,"" weitz says.in addition, the forces that have driven up small-company stocks might not last. small companies have been the darlings of wall street since about 2000, when the bull market in large-company stocks turned into an epic bear market. after seven years, though, the surge in small-cap stocks is starting to look a bit old, says larry puglia, manager of t. rowe price blue chip growth fund.""it's a longer cycle than we typically see,"" puglia says.one reason for the longevity of the bull market for small-cap stocks: a flurry of buyouts, particularly from private-equity firms, has kept small-company stock prices rising. but if the buyout boom falters, small-company stocks could falter.*momentum. it's a curious fact that on wall street, as in physics, objects in motion tend to continue in motion. recently, large-company stocks have picked up a bit of steam. the s&p 500, for example, outperformed its comparable small-cap and midcap indexes in the second quarter.*globalization. ""we're seeing strong economic growth in europe and asia, and the s&p 500 companies are getting about 45% of their sales there,"" says alec young, equity analyst for s&p. the boom in sales abroad, young says, made up for any weakness in the u.s. market in the first half of the year.strong overseas sales boost corporate earnings, and so does the dollar's fall on international currency markets. example: say a company earned 1 million euros 12 months ago. at $1.28 per euro, that equals nearly $1.3 million. but a euro is now worth $1.36. so 1 million euros in overseas earnings now equals nearly $1.4 million.large-caps could also fare well if investors sense an economic slowdown. typically, investors flee to large-caps when the financial world seems uncertain.finally, while any rise in interest rates will hurt stocks of any size, it will hurt small-company stocks the most. that's because small companies are most dependent on borrowing to fuel growth. larger companies can typically manage their borrowing and spending to reduce the ill effects of higher rates.because the s&p 500 closely mirrors the performance of large- company stocks, an s&p 500 index fund is a logical place to put the stock portion of your 401(k) money now. because of their low expenses, these funds have outperformed the average managed fund over the long term.if you don't want to miss out on any lingering small-cap rallies, there's another option, too: an index fund that mirrors the total stock market.these funds typically mirror a very broad index, such as the russell 3000 or the s&p 1500 supercomposite. they're weighted by capitalization -- market price multiplied by number of shares outstanding -- so you'll still own a big dose of large-cap stocks. (large-company stocks make up about 87% of the s&p 1500, young says.) yet you'll also enjoy a boost if small-company stocks continue to soar.graphic, b/w, adrienne lewis, usa today, source: ibbotson & associates; graphics, b/w, source: lipper (chart) (5)",Standard & Poors Corp,1.0,if you re looking for a place to invest the stock portion of your retirement portfolio in the coming months your best bet could well be a fund that tracks the standard poor s 500 stock index large company stocks are still reasonably cheap mildly out of favor and a solid beneficiary of a vibrant world economy index funds are about as plain vanilla an investment as you can get they throw out the fund manager and just try to mirror the results of a stock index because they aren t actively managed they can limit expenses to a bare minimum those low costs let you keep more money in your account you can buy index funds that invest in large companies small companies and everything in between but large company index funds such as those that track the s p 500 or the russell 1000 are particularly compelling now even though the s p 500 has gained a stronger than average 7 this year assuming dividends were reinvested here are three reasons to move part of your 401 k to a large cap index fund now price the s p 500 index now sells for about 16 times its estimated 2007 earnings about its long term average the price earnings ratio shows how cheap a stock is relative to earnings the lower the p e the cheaper the stock or stock index by contrast the s p smallcap 600 index has a considerably higher p e about 19 7 times its estimated 2007 earnings bargain hunter wallace weitz manager of weitz partners fund notes that many stocks that were darlings of the 1990s bull market are still languishing case in point wal mart the retail giant that is selling for about the same price that it did eight years ago in the meantime its earnings have more than doubled i d say it was overvalued then but it s undervalued now weitz says in addition the forces that have driven up small company stocks might not last small companies have been the darlings of wall street since about 2000 when the bull market in large company stocks turned into an epic bear market after seven years though the surge in small cap stocks is starting to look a bit old says larry puglia manager of t rowe price blue chip growth fund it s a longer cycle than we typically see puglia says one reason for the longevity of the bull market for small cap stocks a flurry of buyouts particularly from private equity firms has kept small company stock prices rising but if the buyout boom falters small company stocks could falter momentum it s a curious fact that on wall street as in physics objects in motion tend to continue in motion recently large company stocks have picked up a bit of steam the s p 500 for example outperformed its comparable small cap and midcap indexes in the second quarter globalization we re seeing strong economic growth in europe and asia and the s p 500 companies are getting about 45 of their sales there says alec young equity analyst for s p the boom in sales abroad young says made up for any weakness in the u s market in the first half of the year strong overseas sales boost corporate earnings and so does the dollar s fall on international currency markets example say a company earned 1 million euros 12 months ago at 1 28 per euro that equals nearly 1 3 million but a euro is now worth 1 36 so 1 million euros in overseas earnings now equals nearly 1 4 million large caps could also fare well if investors sense an economic slowdown typically investors flee to large caps when the financial world seems uncertain finally while any rise in interest rates will hurt stocks of any size it will hurt small company stocks the most that s because small companies are most dependent on borrowing to fuel growth larger companies can typically manage their borrowing and spending to reduce the ill effects of higher rates because the s p 500 closely mirrors the performance of large company stocks an s p 500 index fund is a logical place to put the stock portion of your 401 k money now because of their low expenses these funds have outperformed the average managed fund over the long term if you don t want to miss out on any lingering small cap rallies there s another option too an index fund that mirrors the total stock market these funds typically mirror a very broad index such as the russell 3000 or the s p 1500 supercomposite they re weighted by capitalization market price multiplied by number of shares outstanding so you ll still own a big dose of large cap stocks large company stocks make up about 87 of the s p 1500 young says yet you ll also enjoy a boost if small company stocks continue to soar graphic b w adrienne lewis usa today source ibbotson associates graphics b w source lipper chart 5

2825988423,USA TODAY,2023-06-16,News,business,Parents & parentingPSYCHOLOGY,B.8,945,Best tech tips to reduce summer brain drain in kids,"as a mom, it drives me nuts to walk inside on a gorgeous day and see kids stuck on the couch with their noses buried in a screen. with all things tech and growing up these days, balance is key. kids need to spend time outside, playing, socializing, exploring the real world and relaxing. not worrying about schoolwork. it's also really important for parents to set and enforce boundaries around tech for kids, even when it's not fun or easy, explained catherine teitelbaum, a former teacher, and principal at amazon family trust.school might be out for the summer, but that doesn't mean all the stuff your kids learned during the last academic year needs to take a one-way trip to neverland. parents, you know what i'm talking about; that ole' ""summer slide,"" ""skill-slippage ""or so-called ""brain drain."" no matter how what you call it, the fact is it's a major concern for many parents and educators alike.a study published in the american educational research journal in 2020 found that students lost, on average, about 20% of their school-year gains in reading and 27% of their school-year gains in math during summertime. a recent harris poll commissioned by educational software company justsystems underscored those results as well, showing some 91% of elementary school parents in the u.s. want their kids to continue learning over the summer months.the last thing many of us parents want to do over our summer break too is nag, cajole or bribe our kids into doing homework when we all just want to relax and have fun. the good news is there are several new tech tools that can help everyone out – without getting kids stuck on screens.do tablets help kids learn?for millions of kids, a tablet is one of the first devices they use to explore the digital world, but it can be a real double-edged sword too. i've seen kids as young as 2 so sucked in and tuned out watching baby shark on an ipad – they don't realize there's a pair of insanely cute puppies and an entire cream cake sitting right next to them. try to pry it out of their sweaty little palms, and they throw a full-blown hissy fit. it's sad.here's the thing: rather than just hand them your shared adult ipad and hope for the best, invest $200 or less on a tablet built from the wires up just for kids.what should i look for in a kid's tablet?for elementary ages and preteens, you want to consider the overall value of the gadget for the price.battery life: some models over up to 10 hours of battery life. don't consider tdels with fewer than eight hours of battery life.extras: consider what else you get for the price, whether a sturdy case, two-year guarantee and free suite of parental controls or free subscriptions that can provide age-appropriate, kid-focused content without ads, access to social media or adult sites.can i share my ipad with my child instead?ipads are expensive. kids are clumsy. also, when you share an adult tablet with your child, it's a huge hassle to try to set up parental controls that you can easily toggle on and off as you hand it back and forth. for many popular tablet models, you need to pay for a third-party app to go between what grown-ups can access versus what kids can see, do and watch.i talk a lot about training wheel tech. just like you teach your child to ride a bike or swim or eventually drive a car – you don't just toss them into the deep end or hand them the keys and expect it to all go perfectly.it's the same with tech. you have to start with the basics, teach and guide them, then take off the floaties, training wheels and ""student driver"" placard as they mature, grow and get more capable of self-regulation.what are the disadvantages of using technology for kids' education?as a mom, it drives me nuts to walk inside on a gorgeous day and see kids stuck on the couch with their noses buried
