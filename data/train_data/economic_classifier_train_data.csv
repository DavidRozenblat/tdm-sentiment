""ich wandre durch theresienstadt,"" which opened the concert, spoke to a desperate longing for freedom and home. ""wiegala,"" the tender lullaby that ended the program, was a haunting paean to nocturnal silence.what came between spoke to the resilience of the human spirit, even as it endures the unthinkable. there was a mordant humor in karel svenk's ""vsechno jde"" (""anything goes,"" also known as the ""terezin march"") and in an anonymous recasting of a selection from kalman's operetta ""grafin mariza.""viktor ullmann's ""beryozkele"" (""birch tree""), sung in yiddish, and zikmund schul's ""two chassidic dances,"" for violin (originally viola) and cello, showed that the nazi depredations had actually intensified a sense of jewish identity among artists and other intellectuals in the camp.still other works by ullmann, pavel haas and karel berman (the sole composer in the program who survived the war) proved that these composers were versed in the latest international styles and trends.bartok's spirit hovered over two works by erwin schulhoff, a czech composer who was never in theresienstadt but died in the nearby wulzburg camp. his duo for violin and cello, from 1925, featured beguiling blends of timbre and a technically dazzling zingaresca movement. the violin sonata no. 2, written two years later, was lean, muscular and energetic.always a lucid, insightful interpreter, ms. von otter found the expressive heart of everything she sang. mr. forsberg, mr. hope and mr. muller-schott were superb collaborators. a running commentary from the performers usefully illuminated the unimaginable circumstances under which this affecting music was created.terezin-theresienstadt: anne sofie von otter, right, and the pianist bengt forsberg at zankel hall on saturday.(photograph by hiroyuki ito for the new york times)",

(laughs.)q: when it comes to food porn, ""farewell"" certainly gives ""crazy rich asians"" a run for its money. what do you remember about shooting all those family dinner scenes?awkwafina:i mean, when you go to china, the food is nothing like what you see here. they don't do a general tso's over there, so it's just real hometown cuisine. that specific area really specializes in a couple dishes: one is like this pork or beef marinated in cinnamon, which was amazing. i gained like 50 pounds, it was constant eating. but ""crazy rich asians"" had really good food, too. hungry movies!q: what's it going to be like watching this with your grandma? i imagine it could be pretty emotional.awkwafina:i can't wait for her to see it. i just want her to see that i can speak chinese! she (usually) drags my chinese. (laughs.) but i think it's going to be one of the only movies that i'll do that my grandma will understand. for me to show her something that i'm proud of and she gets is very, very special to me.q: many people were disappointed that ""crazy rich asians"" was passed over by the oscars last week. what was your reaction?awkwafina:i don't think there's any really hard feelings from me or the cast. we had an amazing awards run. the fact that we were able to do that and win best picture at the critics' choice awards, that was awesome. so the fact that it was even recognized (there) is enough. i don't think any of us are ""mad"" – that's just how it goes.",

2293461759,New York Times,2019-09-20,Review,C,Art galleries & museums,C.13,1523,A Rebellion Brought Into Focus,"alvin baltrop's photographs of the abandoned hudson river piers and the people who populated them in the 1970s and '80s have been all but ignored. until now.new york city is a gateway for fresh art talent but it's also an archive of art careers past. some are visible, in the ""active"" file. most are buried deep. a few surface only after artists have departed, as is the case with the american photographer alvin baltrop, who was unknown to the mainstream art world when he died in 2004 at 55, and who now has a bright, tough monument of a retrospective at the bronx museum of the arts.the show, ""the life and times of alvin baltrop,"" is also a monument to new york itself during the 1970s and '80s, when mr. baltrop did his major work. during those decades, the city was physically falling apart. at the same time, it radiated creative energy. among other things, in the wake of the 1969 stonewall uprising, it was home base for a new gay consciousness.disintegration and rebellion dovetailed in a line of derelict shipping piers that stretched the hudson river between chelsea and greenwich village. isolated from the rest of the city after the collapse of the southernmost section of the elevated west side highway, the piers became a preserve for gay sex and communion, and the primary subject of mr. baltrop's surviving photographs. these include architectural studies of the piers, but also shots of their semi-residential population of homeless people, teenage runaways, sexual adventurers, criminals and artists, a company that mr. baltrop, in effect, joined.at a glance, he might have seemed an outsider to the adjacent west village world. bronx-born, working-class, african-american, bisexual, he came to the scene directly from a three-year stint as a navy medic. the earliest pictures in the show, which has been organized by antonio sergio bessa, director of curatorial and education programs at the bronx museum, were taken aboard the destroyer william k. pratt, where he was stationed at the height of the vietnam war.some shots are of the ship itself as a functioning war machine, which, although it never actually went to southeast asia during mr. baltrop's time, kept its crew busy with on-deck drills. far more interesting and experimental are images of domestic life at sea: sailors sunbathing; napping on deck, and rubbing shoulders in tight living quarters. and most daring, are dramatically posed and lighted studies of nude male bodies: torsos, buttocks, genitals. in these images, the mood is erotic without being furtive. these are clearly collaborations with willing models.after discharge from the service, mr. baltrop returned to new york city, where he lived on the lower east side with a woman named alice and made a living as a taxi driver. by this point, just a few years after stonewall, the piers had become the main stage for an openly expressed gay sexuality, and they drew mr. baltrop in. initially he used his flexible hours as a cabby to visit and photograph them. then, to gain more time, he quit driving, bought a van and, supporting himself as a freelance mover, camped there for days and nights on end.there's no question that he considered his photographs -- particularly of pier 52, then located at the end of gansevoort street, just beyond where the whitney museum of american art now stands -- a long-term project, a mix of historical documentation, insider anthropology, and autobiography. life on the piers, with its definable demographic and culture of confinement, was not so different from that on board a ship, and mr. baltrop viewed it both from afar and up close. the more than 200 pictures in the bronx show are very much about pulling back for the broad view, then zeroing in.he was careful to give the piers a context. he shot the waterfront neighborhood with its bars (the ramrod, badlands, the stud), its transient hotels, and its commercial truck parking lots (which also served as nocturnal trysting places). and he photographed, at varying distances, the abandoned shipping depots and warehouse sheds on the piers themselves.as a group, these images are invaluable contributions to american urban visual history, but also to art history. a lot of new art was happening on the piers. in 1975, the new york artist gordon matta-clark sliced a huge crescent-shaped, light flooded hole in a west-facing wall on pier 52 and titled it ""day's end""; a painter named tava (gustav von will) was doing murals, as were younger contemporaries like mike bidlo and david wojnarowicz. mr. baltrop recorded some of this work, though it seemed incidental to his true interest. what really gripped him was the grandeur and danger of structural ruin, and the people who occupied it.look closely at his panoramic views of pier exteriors and you'll see, in many, the presence of tiny figures, clothed or nude, leaning from windows, lounging around, having sex. and the majority of his shots were of populated interiors. in pier 52, he used a homemade version of a window-cleaner's harness to suspend himself from the ceiling and survey activities below. at the same time, because he became a regular, unthreatening presence, he was able to photograph on-the-ground action, much of it sexual, from an intimate vantage.the piers were not benign places, and mr. baltrop knew it. muggings were common. murders happened. he took chilling pictures of the police fishing bodies from the hudson. (one locally famous waterfront habitué, the drag queen and activist marsha p. johnson, of whom mr. baltrop made a wonderful portrait, was found dead in the river in 1992.) he spoke, later in his life, of ""the frightening, mad, unbelievable, violent, beautiful things that were going on"" at the piers. he was aware that his own attraction to them had a pathological element. ""it became an addiction,"" he said. ""it was like a drug. it was a drug.""yet you find little sense of menace in the photographs, most of which are black and white, with a few in color. raw, cavernous interiors have a church-like luminosity. and, despite repeated images of bare flesh the work can feel erotic but chaste, the way thomas eakins's paintings of adolescent boys at a swimming hole do. much has been made of the ""classical"" poise of explicitly sexual images by baltrop's celebrated contemporaries peter hujar and robert mapplethorpe. but mr. baltrop's a classicist too, just a less self-conscious one.so why has he been all but ignored until fairly recently? again, his outsider status as a queer working-class african-american is a big part of the answer. (he had two small shows, one in a bar where he moonlighted as a bouncer, but one gallery owner who saw the pictures referred to him as ""a real sewer rat type""; another accused him of stealing work by a white photographer.) fortunately, toward the end of his life, he met the painter randal wilcox, who immediately saw the value of his photography and, after mr. baltrop's death from cancer in 2004, rescued it from what could easily have been obliteration.in addition to a cache of personal items -- identity cards, medical records, cameras -- that are in the bronx show, mr. baltrop left behind a handful of beat-up photographic prints and thousands of rolls of film that he couldn't afford to have processed. in 2008, an artforum essay by the writer and curator douglas crimp (reprinted in the exhibition catalog) put mr. baltrop's name into circulation, and his reputation continues to grow. this fall his work will be included in the rehang of the museum of modern art's permanent collection. he's also in the whitney's collection. (on the site of pier 52, which served for more than a decade as his studio and sometime home, a public art project by the artist david hammons, organized by the whitney and the hudson river park trust, began construction this week.)mr. baltrop himself might well be hard pressed today to recognize the part of the city he once recorded. among the show's latest images is one of a pier engulfed in flames and smoke. the picture may well date from around 1986, when the ""sex piers"" began to be demolished by the city, to be replaced by the luxury condos, entertainment centers and the transplanted uptown museum there today. it's gratifying to think of mr. baltrop, brilliant, persistent, and fully resurrected in the bronx show, as the true phoenix arising from the ashes.the life and times of alvin baltropthrough feb. 9 at the bronx museum of the arts, 1040 grand concourse; 718-681-6000, bronxmuseum.org.the life and times of alvin baltrop through feb. 9 at the bronx museum of the arts; 718-681-6000, bronxmuseum.org.",Bronx Museum of the Arts-New York City NY

(i know, such a problem.) in fact, we get along considerably better than she does with her own daughter.i know it's probably just because the two of them have had longer to snipe at each other and don't have as much in common as we do. i'm thankful for our good relationship, but i know my sister-in-law resents it. she is jealous. should i take a step back so the two of them can reconnect, or is this none of my business?it verges on none of your business, and it does sound like a problem of history between them, yet a third party like you can help soften things between them - or at least not aggravate an existing problem - without actually meddling.how? just be inclusive. work on your relationship with your sister-in-law both when it's just the two of you alone and when her mom is around. if it does start to feel like meddling - like you're matchmaking - then step back a bit to where you're just setting an example for each of them on how to get along with the other.that is, assuming your sister-in-law wants to be included more. if she rebuffs you, and persistence would be condescending or forced, then just continue to be kind to her. define yours as a do-no-harm role in this clan.dear carolyn:after issuing a very polite ""no thank you"" to several events, i'm noticing some pushback from the planners. at least two demanded what my reasons were for declining and then went on to speculate that said reasons weren't good enough. i have always thought my reasons for saying no are just that, my own.while i don't feel i owe an explanation every time i decline, i do value these invitations. when is it okay to feel okay about saying no?saying ""no""always, unless you've already said yes and you're backing out for a better offer or other selfish reasons; or you're aware that someone is counting on you, and you're weaseling; or you're saying no because you're afraid to go, and you're in a well-worn groove of not challenging yourself.otherwise, the only reason to feel bad about getting pushback is that you have boundary-challenged friends. ""i have other commitments"" is more than you owe anyone who is pressing you for reasons, but there's no reason to be a purist; offer it as your reason, then don't budge from there.re: saying ""no"":i think a bit of context can help here, too. when i was going through a rather hard time, i started saying no to everything, including family weddings, because i simply did not want to deal. a few people did push back, because they saw a pattern that i did not. it made me angry at the time, but now i am glad they did so. it helped push me toward some much-needed therapy. if you're always saying no, i think a good friend will gently nudge to figure out why.good point. i do think it's important, though, for gentle nudgers to make it clear that they're worried about you vs. worried about what your absence says about them.write to",
856687362,New York Times,2011-03-13,Commentary,WK,Mass transit,WK.3,1158,Not in My (Liberal) Backyard,"park slope, brooklyn. cape cod, mass. berkeley, calif. three famously progressive places, right? the yin to the tea party yang. but just try putting a bike lane or some wind turbines in their lines of sight. and the karma can get very different.last week, two groups of new yorkers who live ""on or near"" prospect park west, a prestigious address in park slope, filed a suit against the administration of mayor michael r. bloomberg to remove a nine-month-old bike lane that has commandeered a lane previously used by cars.in massachusetts, the formidable opponents of cape wind, a proposed offshore wind farm in nantucket sound, include members of the kennedy family, whose compound looks out over the body of water. in berkeley last year, the objections of store owners and residents forced the city to shelve plans for a full bus rapid transit system (b.r.t.), a form of green mass transit in which lanes that formerly served cars are blocked off and usurped by high-capacity buses that resemble above-ground subways.critics in new york contend the new prospect park bike lane is badly designed, endangering pedestrians and snarling traffic. cape wind opponents argue the turbines will defile a pristine body of water. and in berkeley, store owners worried that reduced traffic flow and parking could hurt their business.but some supporters of high-profile green projects like these say the problem is just plain old nimbyism -- the opposition by residents to a local development of the sort that they otherwise tend to support.""it's really pretty innocuous -- it's a bike lane, for goodness' sake -- their resistance has been incredibly frustrating,"" said walter hook, executive director of the institute for transportation and development policy in manhattan and an expert on sustainable transport. he lives in brooklyn and uses the prospect park west bike lane to get around.nimbyism is nothing new. it's even logical sometimes, perhaps not always deserving of opprobrium. after all, it is one thing to be a passionate proponent of recycling, and another to welcome a particular recycling plant -- with the attendant garbage-truck traffic -- on your street. general environmental principals may be at odds with convenience or even local environmental consequences.but policymakers in the united states have been repeatedly frustrated by constituents who profess to worry about the climate and count themselves as environmentalists, but prove unwilling to adjust their lifestyles or change their behavior in any significant way.in europe, bike lanes crisscross cities, wind turbines appear in counties with high-priced country homes and plants that make green energy from waste are situated in even the wealthiest neighborhoods. so what is going on here?robert b. cialdini, an emeritus professor at arizona state university who studies environmental behaviors, points to two phenomena:humans hew to the ""normative"" behaviors of their community. in places where bike lanes or wind turbines or b.r.t. systems are seen as an integral part of society, people tend not protest a new one; if they are not the norm, they will. second, whatever feelings people have about abstract issues like the environment, in practice they react more passionately to immediate rewards and punishments (like a ready parking space) than distant consequences (like the threat of warming).test yourself: when a sign in a hotel bathroom exhorts you to reuse your towel for the sake of the planet, do you nonetheless tend to throw it on the floor to get a new one? (me: guilty.) ""i'm a persuasion researcher, and here you have convenience and luxury working against you -- just like in the bike-lane issue, "" professor cialdini said.professor cialdini's research has found that the best way to get a guest to reuse towels is to inform him that a majority of the previous guests in that room did not switch towels daily. likewise, in a study to determine how to get people to reduce home energy use, conducted with wesley schultz, professor cialdini found that people were most likely to comply if told that all the neighbors were doing it -- rather than informed that saving energy would save money or was good for the planet.""people need to be in alignment with their contemporaries,"" he said. ""it validates them. it becomes something they should do and can do.""has mayor bloomberg's rapid expansion of bike lanes simply outpaced the otherwise progressive norms of park slope's most upscale street? the bloomberg administration says that according to polls, nearly three-quarters of people in brooklyn support the bike lane, which has resulted in fewer accidents and lower car speeds on prospect park west. the opponents, who note that bicyclists could just as well use a bike lane within the park, contend that the city is manipulating the data and failed to conduct follow-up studies on safety.in interviews with pedestrians and motorists on prospect park west, opponents stridently criticized the bike lane -- though (this being park slope) nearly everyone made a point of saying they generally approved of cycling. (one of the groups bringing the lawsuit is called neighbors for better bike lanes; the group opposed to cape wind is called the alliance to protect nantucket sound.)brian williamson, a 39-year-old accountant who was picking up his children in a minivan, said that crossing the two-way bike lane was hazardous because the cyclists sped and had no red lights. ""i really despise it -- it has had a really negative impact on anyone who uses a car,"" he said.but, of course, that is partly the point: as a matter of environmental policy, a principal benefit of bike lanes is that they tip the balance of power away from driving and toward a more sustainable form of transportation.so what will happen to the park slope bike path or the cape wind turbines or the berkeley b.r.t.? will bike paths become as much the norm in new york as they are in copenhagen, where some 30 percent of all trips are on two wheels? will we get used to looking out for cyclists as we do for cars? will we become so accustomed to views of wind turbines that we no longer ""see"" them any more than we do phone lines now?i recall last year interviewing hans rast, a retired engineer who lives in an elegant suburb of copenhagen, whose backyard sits just several hundred meters from the gate of a huge plant that converts garbage to green heat and electricity. with dozens of such waste-to-energy plants in denmark, new buyers in his development are usually o.k. with the hulking neighbor behind their homes, he said, adding, ""what they like is they look outside and see the forest.""drawings (drawings by rumors)",
2460220538,New York Times,2020-11-14,News,A,StudentsEDUCATION,A.1,1609,Biden Eager to Dismantle DeVos's School Rules,"president-elect joseph r. biden jr. has presented an education agenda that is starkly different from the trump era, beginning with a far more cautious approach to school reopenings.washington -- like most federal agencies, the education department followed president trump's lead in seeking to undo the legacy of his predecessor, and education secretary betsy devos diligently tore into president barack obama's policies.president-elect joseph r. biden jr. is planning to return the favor.the contrasts in trump-era education policy and the incoming biden agenda are stark. ms. devos, a lifelong booster of private schools and opponent of the teachers' unions, set out to reduce the education department's footprint by proposing cuts to public school funding and narrowing the department's enforcement of federal education laws and civil rights.the incoming first lady, jill biden, is a community college professor and member of the national education association, the nation's largest teachers' union. the biden administration has promised to drastically increase resources for public schools, expand civil rights advocacy for marginalized students and reassert department leadership in policymaking.on the most pressing issue facing education, reopening schools during the pandemic, the biden administration has signaled a sharply different approach.the trump administration has demanded that schools reopen, despite severe budget constraints and confusing health guidelines, while the education department has all but absolved itself of tracking the virus's impact and offering solutions. the biden campaign has promised federal relief funding and assistance for schools to address the devastating effects of the pandemic on the academic trajectory of their most vulnerable students.but the president-elect's closeness with the powerful teachers' unions has raised concerns. unions have come under fire from parents and school leaders who say their opposition to in-person instruction conflicts with science and students' well-being. ms. devos posted a series of articles on twitter that have questioned the unions' roles.""when unions win, kids lose,"" she said.with a likely republican senate and a narrow democratic majority in the house, mr. biden will struggle to accomplish some of his loftiest policy goals. he has promised to bolster funding for special education, institute universal prekindergarten and triple funding for a federal program that helps schools serving high concentrations of students from low-income families, devoting some of that funding to teacher salaries. in higher education, he has promised free public college, expanding federal financial aid and canceling some student debt.stef feldman, the biden campaign's policy director, told reporters last month that mr. biden would ""be able to get some big, bold education legislation passed and certainly immediate relief for our schools and our educators, but that doesn't mean that we're not also going to take executive action within existing authority.""those actions could come quickly.mr. biden has promised to appoint a secretary with teaching experience and a deep knowledge of the challenges schools and students face.in his victory speech on nov. 7, the president-elect referred to dr. biden as he declared: ""for america's educators, this is a great day. you're going to have one of your own in the white house.""the biden administration plans to restore obama-era civil rights guidance -- rescinded by ms. devos -- that allowed transgender students to choose their school bathrooms, addressed the disproportionate disciplining of black students and pressed for diversity in colleges and k-12 classrooms. the restoration of those guidance documents can be done immediately because they were not put through the regulatory process or enacted into law.undoing what is arguably ms. devos's most formidable accomplishment -- rules for federally funded schools investigating sexual misconduct -- could be tougher. the incoming administration has vowed to dismantle those rules. as vice president, mr. biden had personally helped introduce the obama-era guidelines on campus sexual misconduct that ms. devos reversed through formal rule-making.but unlike guidance documents, which do not carry the force of law, and other devos regulatory measures that have been overturned by courts, the sexual misconduct rules have already held up against legal challenges. the rules would have to be overturned through legislation or rewritten through the regulatory system, a process that could take years.mr. biden's team is also eyeing ms. devos's formal rules that tightened obama-era regulations on loan forgiveness for students defrauded by their colleges and that eased oversight of for-profit colleges. those rules could also require regulatory action if they survive court challenges.the administration is likely to prioritize the immense backlog of loan forgiveness claims that the trump administration let pile up, and the denials of assistance the department has issued to students who claim they were cheated by their colleges, according to officials familiar with the plans. among the thousands of students awaiting relief are those who attended corinthian colleges, a now defunct for-profit college chain that vice president-elect kamala harris sued as attorney general of california.""there's a lot of work to be done, but it will be nice to know there's an education secretary who's thinking about how to protect students from predatory schools instead of the other way around,"" said aaron ament, the president of the national student legal defense network, which has sued the department for its rollbacks of loan forgiveness and consumer protection rules.the team mr. biden has named to help the education department through the transition signaled the direction he intends to take.leading the team is linda darling-hammond, the president of the palo alto, calif.-based learning policy institute, who also oversaw the education transition for mr. obama in 2008. ms. darling-hammond, a veteran researcher and policymaker in arenas like desegregation, school finance and teacher preparation, was considered a contender for mr. biden's secretary of education, but took herself out of the running, saying she was committed to her work in california.the transition team's strong representation from former obama-era officials and teachers' unions has been met with mixed reactions.keri rodrigues, the president of the national parents union, which represents low-income parents and parents of color, said the composition of the team made her worried that the biden administration might stack the government with people who are ""interested in fortifying the status quo that has been failing so many of our kids.""""this is the biggest table right now,"" she said of the transition team, ""and i don't see parent groups, family groups, community groups present."" she added, ""it seems we're back to the same old, 'we're going to do things to you, not with you.""'unions were not seen as key players in the obama administration's coalition -- the national education association called for the resignation of mr. obama's first education secretary, arne duncan -- and have been at odds with centrist democrats on some policy issues, such as charter schools, which are supported by many black and latino families. mr. biden this summer reshaped the democratic platform to embrace a ban on federal funding for for-profit charters, and to call for cutting funding to underperforming charters run by nonprofit organizations.""he's coming in saying he wants to unify people, and it'll be interesting to see whether that holds for education policy,"" said charles barone, the director of policy at democrats for education reform. ""if you really respect the role of people who got you elected, are you going to come in and attack the choices they make for their children?""teachers' unions have curried favor by fighting ms. devos at every turn, but mr. biden's alliance with them has raised concerns.""if it looks like the teachers' unions are now calling the shots, and not the people schools are supposed to be serving, the pendulum will swing the other way,"" said neal mccluskey, the director of the libertarian cato institute's center for educational freedom.mr. biden has echoed union concerns that the country needs to get the coronavirus under control to safely reopen schools, and that it will take a large infusion of cash to meet safety guidelines and the needs of students who have suffered academic and social setbacks.""schools, they need a lot of money to open,"" mr. biden said during the last presidential debate, citing the need for better ventilation systems, smaller class sizes and more teachers.while mr. trump has emphasized low infection rates among children, mr. biden has also stressed concerns for educators. during one of the debates, after mr. trump accused him of wanting to keep the country locked down, mr. biden mocked the president: ""all you teachers out there, not that many of you are going to die, so don't worry about it.""becky pringle, the national education association's president, said mr. biden understood that ""no school system budget has a line item that says, 'coronavirus.""'ms. pringle noted that mr. biden had always been a strong supporter of the labor movement and said she was proud that he had also ""leaned in"" to the association's playbook.""he'll take the slings and arrows for being 'too close' to us, and he'll be able to say, 'not only did they help me get elected, they help me lead in a bold way,""' she said.union leaders top speculative short lists of contenders to be the next education secretary and will undoubtedly influence mr. biden's choice. randi weingarten, the president of the american federation of teachers, and lily eskelsen garcía, a past president of the national education association, are among the names mentioned.other names include superintendents of districts like baltimore and seattle, and representative jahana hayes, democrat of connecticut and a former national teacher of the year.ms. weingarten said that she was honored by the mention, but that she would be ""really happy to work with the biden administration as the president of the a.f.t.""""the biden-harris administration has the potential to enable a renaissance in public education,"" she said.",Department of Education

1923782015,USA TODAY,2017-04-02,News,,Sports injuries,n/a,943,Major League salaries: Dodgers' Clayton Kershaw leads with $33 million,"the full-fledged opening of the baseball season evokes a similar excitement to the start of a long-distance race, where the competitors know they're in for an endurance test but still can't wait to get going.monday's opening day presents a number of intriguing storylines that could set the initial tone for the six months to come. among them:back with a flourish: los angeles dodgers ace clayton kershaw was well on his way to a fourth cy young award-- with an 11-2 record and 1.79 era through june 26 -- when a back injury sidelined him for 2 a 1/2 months. kershaw was equally sharp upon his return, but wound up with just 21 starts, the fewest since his rookie season of 2008.now he's back in full health as the leader of a club that has claimed the last four nl west crowns but has failed to reach the world series in nearly three decades.as was the case last season, kershaw and the dodgers will get started by facing the hapless san diego padres, though this time at dodger stadium. last year, some 120 miles south, he yielded one hit over seven innings in a 15-0 win. that outing improved kershaw's record to 4-0 with a 0.93 era in six opening day starts, with 44 strikeouts and just six walks in 38 1/3 innings. in other words, he's ready to dominate from the get-go.be afraid. be very afraid.mccutchen's switch: andrew mccutchen has played no other defensive position than center field in his eight major league seasons, all of them with the pittsburgh pirates. today he makes his debut as a right fielder in aa| fenway park?yes, the need for at least one interleague game every day, due to having 15 teams in each league, brings about the hardly traditional matchup of the pirates and boston red sox on day one. that means mccutchen will have to be mindful of the pesky pole corner and the short fence in right field -- torii hunter can tell him how easy it is to flip over into the bullpen --  but at least the green monster will be gregory polanco's concern.polanco will be switching outfield corners, going from right to left as part of a new alignment that sends two-time gold glove-winner starling marte to center.mccutchen, the 2013 mvp and the face of the pirates for years, has made it clear he's not crazy about the move but will not fight it. he does have a pretty good figure to emulate in hall of famer roberto clemente, a 12-time gold glover who set the standard for right field play in pittsburgh.national attention: president trump won't be bringing his hardball style to nationals park -- the washington nationals said he turned down a chance to throw out the ceremonial first pitch -- but the local club has a pretty hard thrower in store nonetheless in stephen strasburg.the eternally tantalizing right-hander will be taking the ball for the inaugural against the miami marlins because cy young award winner max scherzer is still recovering from a fractured finger, but strasburg has plenty of experience and star power of his own.strasburg, who forsook free agency to sign a seven-year, $175 million extension in may, will be making his fourth opening day start in the last six years and registered a 2.25 era in the previous three. he's coming off a 15-4 season but missed most of the last month and the playoffs with an injury and has pitched more than 185 innings just once. fans of the defending nl east-champ nationals keep waiting for him to deliver on his promise.the marlins will be wearing a patch with the no. 16 in memory of star pitcher jose fernandez, killed in a boating accident in september.""the guy coming in after vin:"" those are the words used by joe davis, who understandably eschews the term ""replacing"" when describing his duties as the dodgers' new lead tv play-by-play announcer following the retirement of the legendary vin scully after last season.scully's lyrical

town: in an offseason that saw several big-name free agents re-sign with their clubs -- such as yoenis cespedes, kenley jansen and jose bautista -- slugger edwin encarnacion was an exception, leaving the toronto blue jays after eight years to sign a three-year, $60 million deal with the cleveland indians.monday marks his debut with the defending al champions in a clash of 2016 division winners against the host texas rangers.encarnacion, who averaged 39 homers, 110 rbi and a .912 on-base-plus-slugging percentage over the last five years, adds big-time thump to a lineup that is also welcoming

2300505438,New York Times,2019-10-04,News,A,Political parties,A.17,1375,Republican 'Young Gun' Is Spoiling for Rematch,"she describes her life story as the ""american dream"" and would have been the first korean-american woman in congress. after losing a congressional race by a very thin margin, she is back for a rematch.la habra, calif. -- when newly elected members of congress traveled to washington for freshman orientation in late november, young kim, 56, flew from her orange county home to join them. not all of the ballots in california's 39th congressional district were counted, but ms. kim believed her narrow lead was solid. after shaking hands with other members at white-tablecloth lunches, she posed for her official portrait and a group photo of all new members. ms. kim was expected to be one of two republican women of color and the first korean-american woman in congress.several days into her rookie duties in late november, with all of the 244,393 ballots in the district counted, the race was officially called: she lost the election. gil cisneros, her democratic opponent and a former republican who ran on preserving obamacare, captured 51.6 percent of the vote. ms. kim would not be a member of the 116th congress.less than six months later, ms. kim announced she would try again. now, the rematch between ms. kim and mr. cisneros will test how blue the 2018 wave in orange county really was. republicans hope that after the narrow loss, they can reclaim the district and two others in the county, which encompasses the birthplace of richard nixon and has long been a bastion for conservatives.""this district is not as far left as many political pundits in washington would like people to believe,"" ms. kim said in an interview. soon after the loss, ms. kim began discussing the possibility of running again with her husband, who is also active in local politics, and their four adult children. it was almost a given that she would try again. ""winners don't quit,"" she said. ""that's why i got back in -- we know we can.""the rematch has a lot in common with the first time ms. kim and mr. cisneros ran against each other. but that time he was running as a moderate, almost highlighting the fact that he had been a registered republican a decade ago, while she made every effort to distance herself from the trump administration's immigration policies.now, impeachment proceedings are underway.last week, mr. cisneros, a navy veteran, joined several of his colleagues with military backgrounds to call for an impeachment inquiry.for months, mr. cisneros was one of the few democratic freshman from california not to back an impeachment inquiry. it was rare, he said, that a constituent raised the impeachment issue with him, though he was confronted by one such voter during a recent town hall. and though national polls released late last week showed public support shifting, there is no clear indicator that an impeachment investigation would be widely embraced by voters here.""i'm not worried about that right now,"" he said in a phone interview. ""we thought it was the right thing to do. this wasn't the mueller report, this is about national security and that will be clear to the american public.""like many republicans in competitive districts, ms. kim has so far stayed silent on the impeachment inquiry and declined an interview request.president trump is despised among much of california, but he remains popular among many republicans in the state. and ms. kim has walked a careful tightrope: she frequently distanced herself from the president during the 2018 campaign, though she now says his record is ""pretty good.""""a lot of people agree that the economy is the number one issue for them, and donald trump is doing the right thing in this area,"" ms. kim said, adding that many voters in the district tell her they support his efforts to dismantle many federal regulations. ""that's a key issue for all voters and especially women,"" she said. ""we're going to need to focus on the results.""the district straddles northern orange county, eastern los angeles county and a slice of san bernardino -- suburban areas that have become popular places for immigrants and their children to settle. demographically, the area has transformed: the district is roughly evenly split between asian-americans, latinos and whites. like ms. kim, many were drawn to the area because of its schools and newer homes, and their influence is clear at strip malls all around the region: ms. kim's last campaign office was flanked by taiwanese and oaxacan restaurants.""national issues here are local issues,"" said mark baldassare, the president of the public policy institute of california, which released an extensive survey wednesday showing that mr. trump's approval rating hovered around 30 percent in the region. ""with demographic changes have come changes in attitude, not just about immigration but also on issues like the environment and taxes.""for years, ms. kim was a district aide to congressman ed royce, and she decided to run almost immediately after his retirement announcement. but with an open primary, there was no guarantee that a republican would advance to the general election and the national party initially stayed out of the race.as democrats rallied to capture several seats in southern california during the midterms, many republicans saw the brightest star in ms. kim, who routinely mentions her experiences as a korean-american immigrant and mother of four. ms. kim's candidacy could be traced to republican efforts after the 2012 election to recruit more candidates of color.this time, top party officials have rallied behind ms. kim. the national republican congressional committee listed her as a possible ""young gun"" -- a show of confidence in her ability to run a successful campaign -- which will lead to more donations and resources. and house minority leader kevin mccarthy, who represents bakersfield, praised her even before she decided to run again.ms. kim believes that more republicans will be motivated to vote with mr. trump at the top of the ticket, but at the same time, the political landscape does not seem more favorable to her.there have been signs of a continued shift away from the republican party even since the midterms. as of last month, registered democrats outnumbered registered republicans in orange county, though the opposite is true in the 39th congressional district.""they are being more realistic,"" she said of republican leaders. ""mine is one of the top priority races for them,"" she added, pointing out that democratic gov. gavin newsom lost in the district, though he won in a landslide statewide. ""that means if you have the right candidate, this is a republican district.""ms. kim likes to refer to her life story as an american dream: her parents left korea in the 1940s and raised their children in guam and hawaii. ms. kim, who was born in south korea and spent her early years in seoul, often served as their translator. after graduating from the university of southern california, she opened a women's clothing manufacturing company with her husband, eventually leaving it to work for mr. royce, as a liaison to the asian-american community in the district.""for the longest time, the republican party has been the party of opportunities and i'm an example of that,"" she said.historically, the party has not cultivated people with her background for political opportunities, though that has changed dramatically in the last several years, particularly in southern california, where several asian-american women are running as republicans in 2020.but ms. kim bristles at the suggestion that she is being embraced simply because of a demographic imperative. ""the party looks at us as qualified individuals who happen to be immigrant women. they are supporting me because they feel i'm the best candidate, not because of my background.""still, ms. kim said, republicans need to do much more to reach out to asian and latino voters. she pointed to chronic challenges with homelessness, for example, and the rising cost of living in california as problems created by democrats. and if all anyone wants to talk about is impeachment, change the subject.""just tell them about the issues they care about,"" she said, ""regardless of what they feel about our president as a person.""",Republican Party

""this is a little bit of a zoo because of the numbers, but there's a lot of benefits. you get to watch them move, watch them run, see if they're really 6-3, 215 pounds.""there are lots of high school coaches who think the combines and training camps are a waste of effort. that's what i thought until saturday.the chance to be seen by so many influential college coaches and to compete against the best is too valuable to bypass.the players are tested in the early sessions while coaches stand in a roped-off area mostly talking with each other. others are paying attention to players running 40-yard sprints, throwing and jumping. pat ruel, usc's offensive line coach, has brought along binoculars so he can get an up-close view of the linemen.later, players take part in position drills, and the coaches are allowed to freely roam the field. the coaches want the players to know they are there. each one is wearing either a hat or shirt with an insignia identifying their school, and the players notice.kenny rowe, a highly recruited defensive end from long beach poly, is moving from drill to drill, but he's asked if he sees any particular schools represented. he starts rattling off, ""usc, ucla, mississippi, oregon, washington ... ""some schools have brought as many as six coaches to the event so that each can evaluate players at respective positions.""this is great for kids,"" said rice, who gave a pep talk to the players. ""these guys have an opportunity of a lifetime. you get a chance to showcase what you can do.""but scholarships are more likely to be offered based on a performance at a specific college training camp during the summer than this one in may because there are too many players to evaluate and the coaches aren't working with the players individually.""all this doesn't mean anything unless you can put on the pads,"" linebacker jordan campbell of norco said. ""a guy can run a 4.4 40, but can he take a hit?""there are 12 nike training camps held throughout the country, and there is uncertainty whether coaches will be allowed to attend future camps. an ncaa rule adopted last month will ban coaches from attending combines that are devoted exclusively to testing for agility, speed and strength. what elements must be included in a training camp that would allow college coaches to attend is still be to interpreted, said erik price, an assistant commissioner for the pacific 10 conference.many camp participants already had scholarship offers but wanted to test themselves against other top prospects.chris forcier, a quarterback from san diego st. augustine, has committed to ucla. he said he was interested in trying to convince others that he's one of the best in the nation.most of the coaches already knew before the camp who they wanted to see, and it's a chance for them to confirm their initial impressions or discover something they didn't notice on video.there are risks involved for the athletes, such as letting everyone know they aren't as tall as listed on their high school roster. and those who might have been involved in other sports would have been wise to skip the camp because it's a grueling, competitive event for which you should train.""it's a necessary thing because you need some kind of standardized test to gauge an athlete,"" said james mitchell, the strength coach at harbor city narbonne, who escorted running back eveian grigsby to the camp. ""it's good because once you get ranked, it ups your credibility.""it helps to have consulted with someone who already went through the recruiting process, and that was the luxury for quarterback ben longshore of canyon country canyon. his brother, nate, a quarterback at california, drove 45 minutes from berkeley to support ben and give advice.""i'm the comic relief,"" nate said. ""i keep him relaxed. i think he has one of the best arms out here, and that's one of the most important things. i'm sure he'll excite some people. he can hum it. i told him to let it loose and show what his arm is all about. if you can be relaxed in a setting like this, the coaches will know you have a comfort level and confidence in your ability.""in the end, the coaches with their designer sunglasses and state- of-the-art cellphones couldn't have been happier.said san diego state assistant jonathan himebauch: ""i think nike is trying to help lower gas prices by getting everyone in one spot, so we have to get off the freeways.""",
434241934,New York Times,2009-12-10,Commentary,A,Public prosecutors,A.43,907,The Joys Of Political Sex,"it's time for political sex scandals to reclaim their rightful place in our national discourse. the way things have been going lately, you'd think extramarital sex only happened to professional athletes.consider the case of senator max baucus of montana. we learned last week that the recently divorced baucus had nominated his girlfriend, melodee hanes, to be a u.s. attorney without warning the white house that they were an item. you would expect this to create quite a buzz. particularly since baucus is a major player in the health care debate, which makes it possible to talk about his sex life while pretending to be discussing the prospects for a public option.but, no, it's been tiger woods, tiger woods. how much can you say about a guy who golfs? a politician with a compulsively wandering eye is not just a hound dog with a famous name. he's a commentary about our judgment as voters, and the viability of our social standards. plus, gossiping about him almost brings some useful information about the political process into the conversation. what would any of us know about how impeachment works if it hadn't been for monica lewinsky?i just cannot get excited about sexual misbehavior that is never going to be investigated by a legislative committee.to be fair, although the republicans instantly called on the senate ethics committee to look into the baucus affair, max and melodee are not likely to actually get investigated. hanes, who was one of three nominees being considered for the u.s. attorney post, withdrew when she and baucus moved in together. if the story lives on in memory, it may be for a statement issued by the senator's office, which began: ""senator baucus is currently in a mature and happy relationship with melodee hanes.""this is a turn of phrase that could be put to good use on so many sensitive occasions, the baucus press office should really go for a copyright.joe bruno, the former majority leader of the new york state senate who was convicted of corruption this week, is in a mature and happy relationship with kay stafford, the chairwoman and president of cma consulting services. (actually, the relationship is really, really mature, since bruno is 80.) when bruno resigned from the senate last year, he quickly got a great job as c.e.o. of cma.a guy who was being investigated by federal prosecutors for his consulting activities would not normally be regarded as a perfect hire for an information technology consulting business, particularly when he seems to know as much about information technology as he does about quantum physics. still, it was nice to finally see a woman on the powerful, job-dispensing side of these stories.one of the positive aspects of recent political gossip is that the women seem to be getting tougher. jenny sanford, who won public acclaim for refusing to stand by her husband, south carolina gov. mark sanford, during the appalachian trail debacle, was just named one of the ""10 most fascinating people in 2009"" on a barbara walters special. (her fellow honorees included kate gosselin, the betrayed-wife-and-mother-of-sextuplets, lady gaga and adam lambert. the clear message here is that the best routes to being fascinating are an adulterous husband or lots of eye makeup.)on the show, she repeated her contention that even if her husband had asked her to stand next to him during his confessional press conference, she wouldn't have complied. we can probably look back on 2009 as the year that finished off the loyal-wife-photo-op, even though in the sanfords' case, having jenny in the room would have helped. she might not have looked all that supportive, but when the governor promised to give the assembled press corps ""way more detail than you'll ever want,"" she probably would have slapped her hand over his mouth.a subcommittee in the state legislature voted on wednesday not to impeach sanford and merely voted unanimously to censure him for bringing ""ridicule, dishonor, disgrace and shame"" to his state. a great victory! sanford will be able to finish his term and perhaps go on to a rewarding career as an adventure vacation guide, or professional wrestling referee.that leaves senator john ensign of nevada as the current holder of the most likely to be turned out of office title. the ethics committee is investigating efforts ensign made to help his ex-aide, doug hampton, get a lobbying job after hampton found out that his boss was sleeping with mrs. hampton.hampton, you may remember, first told his story with the remark: ""all of those tentacles were birthed because john needed things to go down like this."" obviously not the easiest guy to place.this could be a new rule of political sex: never have an affair with the wife of an employee. but if you do, make sure you are not the only person in the world who would hire the cuckolded husband.of course, that comes after the prime directive: never have an affair with anyone who would enjoy seeing themselves on the cover of ""in touch"" magazine.that was the point where tiger should have been paying attention.gail collins   nicholas d. kristof is off today.",

involving rape allegations or other highly sensitive matters to keep their identities cloaked at trial. perhaps the most notable is the landmark abortion rights case roe vs. wade, in which the plaintiff was known as jane roe. and in a case frequently cited by judges and lawyers, the federal appeals court in california allowed a group of immigrant garment workers to sue their employer anonymously because of deportation concerns.but usually, federal judges insist that the parties in a lawsuit be identified at trial, experts said. attempts to shield information presented in court from public view must be weighed against the longstanding principle that shining a light on the workings of the judiciary guards against injustice, incompetence or fraud.""for the most part, judges have been reluctant to allow pseudonyms, because they're afraid of violating this very fundamental tenet of judicial openness,"" said jayne ressler, a professor at brooklyn law school who has studied the question of anonymity in courts.ressler said many states, including california, readily grant anonymity to rape victims in criminal proceedings, but those protections do not necessarily carry over into civil trials.in a similar case, a 27-year-old woman also using the pseudonym jane doe filed a lawsuit two years ago in washington, d.c., accusing cincinnati reds pitcher alfredo simon cabrera of rape. a federal court judge ruled that she could remain anonymous only until the trial. the case was dismissed at her request late last year.the tendency of civil court judges to favor openness when it comes to rape claims frustrates ressler and others, such as meg garvin, executive director of the national crime victim law institute. allowing a woman to go through trial as a jane doe does little to reduce a court's transparency, they said, whereas exposing her identity harms her and discourages future victims of sexual assault from coming forward.""the name doesn't matter. what's important is what happened. did the man rape this woman?"" ressler said.the speed with which information now spreads through social media raises the stakes. while most mainstream media outlets generally do not name accusers in rape cases, people posting to online platforms are not bound by such rules.the case involving rose, who was for many years a marquee player with the chicago bulls until a recent trade to new york, has provided a particularly stark example of the conflict between privacy and openness. despite a career beset by injuries, rose, the youngest player ever to win the nba's most valuable player award, has built a huge fan base, as evidenced by his 2.45 million twitter followers.rose and two friends, randall hampton and ryan allen, are accused in the lawsuit of sexually assaulting the woman in the early morning hours one day in august 2013. rose and the woman had been in a relationship for a few years, and on the night in question, the woman has recounted, she went to a party with rose, who was living temporarily in los angeles.the woman alleges that afterward, while drinking at rose's house, the men secretly drugged her. hours later, after she had departed, the men drove to the woman's apartment. the woman alleges the men sexually assaulted her while she was in an ""incapacitated state of consciousness.""rose and the others acknowledge they had sex with the woman, but say it was consensual.the woman sued in los angeles county superior court. rose's lawyers successfully petitioned to move the case to federal district court, saying rose was not a resident of california.the months of legal wrangling in the lead-up to trial have often been ugly. rose's attorney, mark baute, has taken a pugnacious approach, saying the woman's demand for $21 million shows she is trying to shake down rose.""this is not a rape case. it's pure and simple extortion by a plaintiff who wants to hide behind the cloak of anonymity while seeking millions in damages from a celebrity,"" baute wrote in one of many filings.baute forced the issue of the woman's anonymity, arguing in june that the case should be dismissed or the woman be forced to identify herself because rose had been badly disadvantaged by her hidden identity. baute said she had given up her claim to anonymity because she had posted provocative photos of herself using her name online.baute declined to comment on the issue of the woman's anonymity.her attorney, brandon anand, did not respond to requests for comment.fitzgerald rejected baute's arguments, finding that rose's fame heightened the likelihood that identifying the woman ""could subject her to significant harassment and humiliation from the public."" and the judge admonished baute for citing the woman's online photos in his argument, saying they made her no less deserving of protection.""defendant rose,"" the judge wrote, ""appears to suggest that women who publicly portray themselves as 'sexual' are less likely to experience embarrassment, humiliation and harassment associated with gang rape. such rhetoric has no place in this court.""in his ruling, fitzgerald cited the 2003 sex assault case against los angeles lakers star kobe bryant, who was accused by a 19-year-old colorado hotel worker of raping her while she was at work at a mountain resort.despite efforts by the judge in those criminal proceedings to conceal her identity, the woman endured harassment and threats when her name was leaked and spread widely.in his ruling last month, however, fitzgerald wrote that ""as trial approaches, the public's interest in disclosure also increases."" it is well-established, he explained, that open courtrooms are an important element of journalists' and the general public's constitutional right to free speech. keeping the woman's name secret, he said, would risk impinging on those rights.the judge added a second reason for his ruling. if jurors heard the woman referred to as jane doe, they might infer she was being protected because of harm caused by the defendants.the woman's attorney made a last-ditch effort last week to get the judge to reconsider, filing a letter from a los angeles police detective who said she was actively investigating the rape allegation for possible criminal charges and would like the woman's identity to remain secret while the inquiry continued.in the same filing, on which fitzgerald has not ruled, the attorney also submitted screen grabs from social media sites on which people discussed the case and named the woman, denigrating her decision to sue rose. one post dismissed her as a ""gold digger.""the harassment, the woman's lawyer argued, would probably worsen if the woman's identity was made public in court.caption: photo: in the lawsuit, derrick rose

856687362,New York Times,2011-03-13,Commentary,WK,Mass transit,WK.3,1158,Not in My (Liberal) Backyard,"park slope, brooklyn. cape cod, mass. berkeley, calif. three famously progressive places, right? the yin to the tea party yang. but just try putting a bike lane or some wind turbines in their lines of sight. and the karma can get very different.last week, two groups of new yorkers who live ""on or near"" prospect park west, a prestigious address in park slope, filed a suit against the administration of mayor michael r. bloomberg to remove a nine-month-old bike lane that has commandeered a lane previously used by cars.in massachusetts, the formidable opponents of cape wind, a proposed offshore wind farm in nantucket sound, include members of the kennedy family, whose compound looks out over the body of water. in berkeley last year, the objections of store owners and residents forced the city to shelve plans for a full bus rapid transit system (b.r.t.), a form of green mass transit in which lanes that formerly served cars are blocked off and usurped by high-capacity buses that resemble above-ground subways.critics in new york contend the new prospect park bike lane is badly designed, endangering pedestrians and snarling traffic. cape wind opponents argue the turbines will defile a pristine body of water. and in berkeley, store owners worried that reduced traffic flow and parking could hurt their business.but some supporters of high-profile green projects like these say the problem is just plain old nimbyism -- the opposition by residents to a local development of the sort that they otherwise tend to support.""it's really pretty innocuous -- it's a bike lane, for goodness' sake -- their resistance has been incredibly frustrating,"" said walter hook, executive director of the institute for transportation and development policy in manhattan and an expert on sustainable transport. he lives in brooklyn and uses the prospect park west bike lane to get around.nimbyism is nothing new. it's even logical sometimes, perhaps not always deserving of opprobrium. after all, it is one thing to be a passionate proponent of recycling, and another to welcome a particular recycling plant -- with the attendant garbage-truck traffic -- on your street. general environmental principals may be at odds with convenience or even local environmental consequences.but policymakers in the united states have been repeatedly frustrated by constituents who profess to worry about the climate and count themselves as environmentalists, but prove unwilling to adjust their lifestyles or change their behavior in any significant way.in europe, bike lanes crisscross cities, wind turbines appear in counties with high-priced country homes and plants that make green energy from waste are situated in even the wealthiest neighborhoods. so what is going on here?robert b. cialdini, an emeritus professor at arizona state university who studies environmental behaviors, points to two phenomena:humans hew to the ""normative"" behaviors of their community. in places where bike lanes or wind turbines or b.r.t. systems are seen as an integral part of society, people tend not protest a new one; if they are not the norm, they will. second, whatever feelings people have about abstract issues like the environment, in practice they react more passionately to immediate rewards and punishments (like a ready parking space) than distant consequences (like the threat of warming).test yourself: when a sign in a hotel bathroom exhorts you to reuse your towel for the sake of the planet, do you nonetheless tend to throw it on the floor to get a new one? (me: guilty.) ""i'm a persuasion researcher, and here you have convenience and luxury working against you -- just like in the bike-lane issue, "" professor cialdini said.professor cialdini's research has found that the best way to get a guest to reuse towels is to inform him that a majority of the previous guests in that room did not switch towels daily. likewise, in a study to determine how to get people to reduce home energy use, conducted with wesley schultz, professor cialdini found that people were most likely to comply if told that all the neighbors were doing it -- rather than informed that saving energy would save money or was good for the planet.""people need to be in alignment with their contemporaries,"" he said. ""it validates them. it becomes something they should do and can do.""has mayor bloomberg's rapid expansion of bike lanes simply outpaced the otherwise progressive norms of park slope's most upscale street? the bloomberg administration says that according to polls, nearly three-quarters of people in brooklyn support the bike lane, which has resulted in fewer accidents and lower car speeds on prospect park west. the opponents, who note that bicyclists could just as well use a bike lane within the park, contend that the city is manipulating the data and failed to conduct follow-up studies on safety.in interviews with pedestrians and motorists on prospect park west, opponents stridently criticized the bike lane -- though (this being park slope) nearly everyone made a point of saying they generally approved of cycling. (one of the groups bringing the lawsuit is called neighbors for better bike lanes; the group opposed to cape wind is called the alliance to protect nantucket sound.)brian williamson, a 39-year-old accountant who was picking up his children in a minivan, said that crossing the two-way bike lane was hazardous because the cyclists sped and had no red lights. ""i really despise it -- it has had a really negative impact on anyone who uses a car,"" he said.but, of course, that is partly the point: as a matter of environmental policy, a principal benefit of bike lanes is that they tip the balance of power away from driving and toward a more sustainable form of transportation.so what will happen to the park slope bike path or the cape wind turbines or the berkeley b.r.t.? will bike paths become as much the norm in new york as they are in copenhagen, where some 30 percent of all trips are on two wheels? will we get used to looking out for cyclists as we do for cars? will we become so accustomed to views of wind turbines that we no longer ""see"" them any more than we do phone lines now?i recall last year interviewing hans rast, a retired engineer who lives in an elegant suburb of copenhagen, whose backyard sits just several hundred meters from the gate of a huge plant that converts garbage to green heat and electricity. with dozens of such waste-to-energy plants in denmark, new buyers in his development are usually o.k. with the hulking neighbor behind their homes, he said, adding, ""what they like is they look outside and see the forest.""drawings (drawings by rumors)",

2300505438,New York Times,2019-10-04,News,A,Political parties,A.17,1375,Republican 'Young Gun' Is Spoiling for Rematch,"she describes her life story as the ""american dream"" and would have been the first korean-american woman in congress. after losing a congressional race by a very thin margin, she is back for a rematch.la habra, calif. -- when newly elected members of congress traveled to washington for freshman orientation in late november, young kim, 56, flew from her orange county home to join them. not all of the ballots in california's 39th congressional district were counted, but ms. kim believed her narrow lead was solid. after shaking hands with other members at white-tablecloth lunches, she posed for her official portrait and a group photo of all new members. ms. kim was expected to be one of two republican women of color and the first korean-american woman in congress.several days into her rookie duties in late november, with all of the 244,393 ballots in the district counted, the race was officially called: she lost the election. gil cisneros, her democratic opponent and a former republican who ran on preserving obamacare, captured 51.6 percent of the vote. ms. kim would not be a member of the 116th congress.less than six months later, ms. kim announced she would try again. now, the rematch between ms. kim and mr. cisneros will test how blue the 2018 wave in orange county really was. republicans hope that after the narrow loss, they can reclaim the district and two others in the county, which encompasses the birthplace of richard nixon and has long been a bastion for conservatives.""this district is not as far left as many political pundits in washington would like people to believe,"" ms. kim said in an interview. soon after the loss, ms. kim began discussing the possibility of running again with her husband, who is also active in local politics, and their four adult children. it was almost a given that she would try again. ""winners don't quit,"" she said. ""that's why i got back in -- we know we can.""the rematch has a lot in common with the first time ms. kim and mr. cisneros ran against each other. but that time he was running as a moderate, almost highlighting the fact that he had been a registered republican a decade ago, while she made every effort to distance herself from the trump administration's immigration policies.now, impeachment proceedings are underway.last week, mr. cisneros, a navy veteran, joined several of his colleagues with military backgrounds to call for an impeachment inquiry.for months, mr. cisneros was one of the few democratic freshman from california not to back an impeachment inquiry. it was rare, he said, that a constituent raised the impeachment issue with him, though he was confronted by one such voter during a recent town hall. and though national polls released late last week showed public support shifting, there is no clear indicator that an impeachment investigation would be widely embraced by voters here.""i'm not worried about that right now,"" he said in a phone interview. ""we thought it was the right thing to do. this wasn't the mueller report, this is about national security and that will be clear to the american public.""like many republicans in competitive districts, ms. kim has so far stayed silent on the impeachment inquiry and declined an interview request.president trump is despised among much of california, but he remains popular among many republicans in the state. and ms. kim has walked a careful tightrope: she frequently distanced herself from the president during the 2018 campaign, though she now says his record is ""pretty good.""""a lot of people agree that the economy is the number one issue for them, and donald trump is doing the right thing in this area,"" ms. kim said, adding that many voters in the district tell her they support his efforts to dismantle many federal regulations. ""that's a key issue for all voters and especially women,"" she said. ""we're going to need to focus on the results.""the district straddles northern orange county, eastern los angeles county and a slice of san bernardino -- suburban areas that have become popular places for immigrants and their children to settle. demographically, the area has transformed: the district is roughly evenly split between asian-americans, latinos and whites. like ms. kim, many were drawn to the area because of its schools and newer homes, and their influence is clear at strip malls all around the region: ms. kim's last campaign office was flanked by taiwanese and oaxacan restaurants.""national issues here are local issues,"" said mark baldassare, the president of the public policy institute of california, which released an extensive survey wednesday showing that mr. trump's approval rating hovered around 30 percent in the region. ""with demographic changes have come changes in attitude, not just about immigration but also on issues like the environment and taxes.""for years, ms. kim was a district aide to congressman ed royce, and she decided to run almost immediately after his retirement announcement. but with an open primary, there was no guarantee that a republican would advance to the general election and the national party initially stayed out of the race.as democrats rallied to capture several seats in southern california during the midterms, many republicans saw the brightest star in ms. kim, who routinely mentions her experiences as a korean-american immigrant and mother of four. ms. kim's candidacy could be traced to republican efforts after the 2012 election to recruit more candidates of color.this time, top party officials have rallied behind ms. kim. the national republican congressional committee listed her as a possible ""young gun"" -- a show of confidence in her ability to run a successful campaign -- which will lead to more donations and resources. and house minority leader kevin mccarthy, who represents bakersfield, praised her even before she decided to run again.ms. kim believes that more republicans will be motivated to vote with mr. trump at the top of the ticket, but at the same time, the political landscape does not seem more favorable to her.there have been signs of a continued shift away from the republican party even since the midterms. as of last month, registered democrats outnumbered registered republicans in orange county, though the opposite is true in the 39th congressional district.""they are being more realistic,"" she said of republican leaders. ""mine is one of the top priority races for them,"" she added, pointing out that democratic gov. gavin newsom lost in the district, though he won in a landslide statewide. ""that means if you have the right candidate, this is a republican district.""ms. kim likes to refer to her life story as an american dream: her parents left korea in the 1940s and raised their children in guam and hawaii. ms. kim, who was born in south korea and spent her early years in seoul, often served as their translator. after graduating from the university of southern california, she opened a women's clothing manufacturing company with her husband, eventually leaving it to work for mr. royce, as a liaison to the asian-american community in the district.""for the longest time, the republican party has been the party of opportunities and i'm an example of that,"" she said.historically, the party has not cultivated people with her background for political opportunities, though that has changed dramatically in the last several years, particularly in southern california, where several asian-american women are running as republicans in 2020.but ms. kim bristles at the suggestion that she is being embraced simply because of a demographic imperative. ""the party looks at us as qualified individuals who happen to be immigrant women. they are supporting me because they feel i'm the best candidate, not because of my background.""still, ms. kim said, republicans need to do much more to reach out to asian and latino voters. she pointed to chronic challenges with homelessness, for example, and the rising cost of living in california as problems created by democrats. and if all anyone wants to talk about is impeachment, change the subject.""just tell them about the issues they care about,"" she said, ""regardless of what they feel about our president as a person.""",Republican Party

1034336215,New York Times,2012-08-21,News,A,Stop & frisk,A.1,1233,"Majority in City See Police Dept. As Favoring Whites, a Poll Finds","a significant majority of new yorkers say the police department favors whites over blacks, according to a new poll by the new york times.that view, as widespread now as it was in 2001 during the administration of mayor rudolph w. giuliani, is particularly prevalent among black new yorkers, 80 percent of whom say the police favor one race over the other. a plurality of white residents -- 48 percent -- agree.concern about police favoritism comes at a time of intensified scrutiny of the department's extensive practice of stopping, questioning and, in many instances, frisking people on the city's streets. last year, the police made nearly 700,000 stops; about 85 percent of the stops involved blacks or hispanics.the poll found that a majority of black residents said the stop-and-frisk tactic had led to the harassment of innocent people, but most white residents viewed the practice as an acceptable way to improve urban safety.among all new yorkers, 48 percent said the tactic was ""acceptable to make new york city safer,"" while almost as many -- 45 percent -- deemed the tactic ""excessive."" most of those surveyed rejected mayor michael r. bloomberg's chief rationale for the practice, saying they did not think that stopping and frisking suspicious people had lowered the crime rate or reduced the use of illegal guns.""stop-and-frisk would be a good idea if they did it right,"" jose aponte, 64, a retired doorman who lives in the bronx, said in a follow-up interview after the poll. ""but it's not decreasing crime or guns. there are more shootings every day.""but mr. bloomberg and the police commissioner, raymond w. kelly, received high marks on the crime issue: 57 percent of new yorkers said they approved of the way the mayor was dealing with crime, and 61 percent said they approved of the way the commissioner was handling his job. even 50 percent of the respondents who said they had been the target of a racially motivated police stop approved of mr. kelly's management.""i live in brooklyn, in coney island, and everybody has guns; 3-year-old kids have guns! it's outrageous,"" said johnny rivera, 52, a former foreman at an aluminum company. as for the stop-and-frisk tactic, he said, ""the worst thing they could do is stop it.""mr. bloomberg, who has overseen a significant rise in the number of stops during his nearly 11 years in office, scored slightly lower on his stewardship of race relations, with half of residents saying they approved and one-third saying they disapproved. just 36 percent of black residents said they approved of the mayor's handling of race relations.james westcott, a bronx resident who has been unemployed for two years, said he had been stopped by the police on three occasions. ""one right after the other, by three different patrol cars,"" mr. westcott, who is black, said. he also said the police had become less considerate, adding, ""it started getting bad when giuliani was mayor, and now it's getting worse and worse.""""you know it's excessive when you see people get stopped who really don't deserve to be stopped, like kids going to school,"" mr. westcott, 44, said. ""the police just jump out, stop them, search them, take their names down, then get back in their car and leave, and the kids don't know what went on.""but some new yorkers, while conceding that the police show favoritism for one race over another, said the stop-and-frisk tactic's ends justified the means.""if that's what it takes, i find it acceptable,"" said jani kipness, 58, a special-education teacher from brooklyn who is white. she said that she thought that officers ""single out minority groups,"" but that ""if you look at the crime in new york, it's less white people; that's just the way it is.""""i wouldn't want to be stopped and frisked,"" she added. ""but if you look at cities like detroit and other cities that have a way higher crime rate than new york, i think new york has to be doing something right.""the stop-and-frisk practice has come under harsh criticism from civil liberties groups and some lower court judges. the issue has become a subject of debate among elected officials and has apparently captured the attention of the public: more than three-quarters of new yorkers interviewed for the poll said they had heard a lot or some about it.the criticism has prompted mr. kelly, who has argued strongly that the stop-and-frisk practice is an important crime-fighting tool, to pledge changes to ensure the lawfulness of the practice. the number of stops fell by more than 34 percent in april, may and june, compared with the previous quarter.crime is not new yorkers' top concern. but more residents cited crime and violence as an important problem than in a times poll two years ago. the proportion who would prefer to keep living in the city, rather than move away, is at the highest level in more than a decade.opinions about the stop-and-frisk practice are divided by race. fifty-five percent of whites described the use of the tactic as acceptable; 56 percent of blacks called it excessive. among hispanics, 48 percent said it was acceptable, and 44 percent said it was excessive. republicans, independents and queens residents generally support the practice; democrats and manhattanites generally deem it excessive.over all, 64 percent of new yorkers said the police favored one race over the other, a steep rise from the early years of the bloomberg administration, when less than half of residents agreed with that sentiment. the last times poll in which the perception of police favoritism was as widespread was taken in 2001, the final year of mayor giuliani's tenure, when race relations were noticeably more tense. (the question has not been asked in a times poll since 2003.)these views, in many cases, appear to have been influenced by personal experience. a third of the new yorkers surveyed, including 37 percent of black people, said police officers had used insulting language toward them. a fifth of the respondents said they had been stopped by a police officer because of their race or ethnicity, and almost all were black or hispanic, and more likely to be young and male.""in the bronx, brooklyn, queens, they will stop and frisk blacks and hispanics more,"" said kevon geanus, 20, a construction worker who is black and lives in the bronx.

1690306948,New York Times,2015-06-23,News,A,Budgets,A.17,843,De Blasio Is Poised to Add Officers,"mayor bill de blasio, in a sharp shift from his initial objections, is poised to hire nearly 1,300 additional officers for the new york police department, a surprising addition in a $78.5 billion budget deal announced by city leaders on monday night.increasing the size of the force had been a top priority of the city council speaker, melissa mark-viverito, and the notion was endorsed by mr. de blasio's police commissioner, william j. bratton. but the move has been opposed by some advocates for criminal justice reform, and it is expected to add at least $100 million to the city's budget.the mayor, who has pledged to improve police-community relations, has long been hesitant to hire more officers, saying he felt comfortable with the city's near-record-low level of crime. but his administration has come under intense pressure in recent weeks after a notable increase in homicides and shootings compared with the same period last year.""there have been long conversations particularly over the last few weeks on what was the right thing to do,"" mr. de blasio said on monday night at city hall, with ms. mark-viverito at his side. ""we came to a plan that allows us to strengthen our police force while encouraging a deepening of reform, while finding key reforms on the fiscal front.""the budget deal, which is expected to be approved by the full council this week, represents a roughly 4.7 percent increase from the one approved last year. on the police issue, aides to the mayor said the plan included new and hard-fought limits on overtime pay for officers, to blunt the impact of added wages and benefits. about 300 of the new officers would form a new counterterrorism team to patrol areas of the city perceived as high risk, like times square.and in what mr. de blasio billed as a ""pioneering"" step in police reform, the city is expected to debut a new neighborhood-based policing model, in which patrol officers would be given about one-third of their day away from radio calls to develop closer relationships with residents of their precincts.still, some council members were taken aback on monday that mr. de blasio went beyond the 1,000 new officers that ms. mark-viverito had requested. and reform advocates, who had celebrated mr. de blasio's criticism of aggressive policing, were upset.""this deal to increase the n.y.p.d. head count seems like politics at its worst,"" said monifa bandele, a leader of the advocacy group communities united for police reform. ""it's disappointing and perplexing that the city budget will increase the n.y.p.d. head count when systemic problems with police accountability and culture, that allow new yorkers to be abused and killed, have yet to be fixed.""the police department currently has about 34,600 uniformed personnel, a number that will grow by roughly 890 new officers who are to graduate from the police academy on july 2. the force was significantly expanded in the early 1990s, under former mayor david n. dinkins. since then, it has shrunk amid recessions and a sharp drop in urban crime.mr. bratton had allied himself with ms. mark-viverito's request for 1,000 new officers, one of the few points of open contention between the council speaker and the mayor, who are both democrats. the proposed increase in officers had, in turn, been an item of apparent discord between mr. de blasio and his police commissioner, whom the mayor has presented as a close partner.as recently as june 5, mr. de blasio told a radio caller that raising the head count was unnecessary, arguing that officers had already been freed up because his administration had reduced the number of police stops and arrests for possessing small amounts of marijuana.""when you have a force that's effective in the way the n.y.p.d. is now and getting better, i think that's a reason to stick with what we're doing,"" the mayor said during an interview on wnyc.another reason, according to some skeptics, is a fiscal one: the long-term liabilities for the city budget, which would have to add millions for retirement and pension costs. ""the problem is what happens when they've been there awhile and then, really acutely, when they start to retire,"" said nicole gelinas, a senior fellow at the manhattan institute, a right-leaning think tank.""we can only afford to add more cops now because wall street is booming and we're probably in the throes of another real estate bubble,"" ms. gelinas said. ""what happens when that goes away?""the budget deal for the fiscal year beginning in july also included encouraging news for advocates of the city's libraries. the city is to add $39 million in funds to extend library hours and keep many branches open six days a week. ms. mark-viverito also received funding for one of her signature initiatives, the creation of a $1.4 million bail fund that would help low-income defendants accused of low-level crimes.",Police Department-New York City NY
422244463,Los Angeles Times,2010-01-18,News,Main News; Part A; Foreign Desk,Presidency,A.17,785,"In Ukraine, race for presidency will go to runoff","viktor yanukovich, the burly former mechanic ousted by popular revolt just five years ago, salvaged himself to claim top place among contenders for the ukrainian presidency sunday, exit polls indicated.his longtime rival, prime minister yulia tymoshenko, will be a close second, the survey predicted. the exit poll results, if borne out by the slow counting of ballots, mean that the contentious pair will battle for the presidency in a runoff next month.the choice of a new leader marks a milestone in ukraine's post-soviet evolution, and many voters appeared disillusioned and hungry for change -- if wary of fresh rounds of infighting and scrapping for power among the ukrainian elite.a survey from the widely respected national exit poll consortium gave yanukovich 31.5% of the vote to tymoshenko's 27.2%, topping a field of 18 candidates. a runoff will be held because no candidate received more than 50% of the vote.within hours of the polls closing sunday night, the leading candidates were already scrambling to pick up as many of the losing candidates' votes as possible. many analysts believe tymoshenko, 49, will have the advantage in gaining votes in the second round.tymoshenko strode into a news conference grinning from ear to ear and launched into a blistering criticism of yanukovich, 59, calling him the stooge of ""criminals and oligarchs."" she called upon all ukrainians who voted for ""democratic"" candidates to throw their support behind her.""i'm telling those who voted for other democratic candidates, we now have the chance to do what we could never do in the past: to unite all the democratic forces in the country,"" tymoshenko said. ""i'm ready to excuse every democratic candidate for the things they said about me. i'm ready to turn that page.""yanukovich soon chimed in with similar appeals to voters. ""they thought they could make promises from election to election and not fulfill the promises, that people will forget,"" he said of tymoshenko and her allies.the improbable reversal of yanukovich's fortune points up the changes that have rattled ukraine in past years.the last time ukrainians voted for a president, in 2004, yanukovich won but his victory was tarnished by allegations of vote rigging. enraged crowds stormed into the streets to demand his ouster, and the orange revolution was born.the ensuing seasons have been tumultuous and often painful for ukraine. the politicians who had marched boldly through the frigid streets calling for a reinvented ukraine were now in office -- and promptly lost themselves in byzantine power plays, internecine wars and flashy shows of dubiously acquired wealth.meanwhile, the economic crisis under president viktor yushchenko has hammered the country, radically devaluing the currency and spreading unemployment and uncertainty throughout the provinces.""people are feeling that they've been lied to,"" said larisa kuchuba, a 60-year-old engineer who braved snow and thick blankets of black ice sunday to vote in south kiev.kuchuba cast her vote for one of the lesser-known opposition candidates. she didn't believe he stood the slightest chance of winning; her vote was cast in protest, she said.""the politicians did everything to keep one another from succeeding. they didn't do anything for the success of the country,"" she said. ""all they did was fight.""analysts warned that the presidency would be a bitterly fought-for prize, with the candidates accusing one another of fraud and going to court. the battle could drag on for months beyond the runoff.with the exit of yushchenko, whose approval ratings wallowed in the single digits in recent months, ukraine loses a president who strove to shake off the grip of moscow and reorient ukraine as a westernized land with strong allies in brussels and washington.but in a country where many people grow up speaking russian and feel nostalgically, culturally and religiously intertwined with russia, yushchenko's approach chafed nerves -- and eventually backfired as his opponents blamed him for the dangerous deterioration of relations with moscow.the kremlin now appears poised to restore some of its lost influence in ukraine because both leading candidates have friendly relations with russian leaders.in the years since the orange revolution, the very word ""orange"" lost its linguistic role as proud shorthand for the leaders who presented themselves as pro-western reformers and became an adjective generally uttered with a grimace or a roll of the eyes.its affections historically split between russia and europe, ukraine became a coveted battleground for influence between russia and the u.s., which heartily backed its drift away from moscow.but even that status was lost: ukraine found its foreign policy importance downgraded as president obama sought to ease tensions with the kremlin.",

409011454,USA TODAY,2007-07-06,News,MONEY,Investment policy,B.6,833,S& P 500 could still be a bargain ; Global factors favor index of large stocks,"if you're looking for a place to invest the stock portion of your retirement portfolio in the coming months, your best bet could well be a fund that tracks the standard & poor's 500-stock index.large-company stocks are still reasonably cheap, mildly out of favor and a solid beneficiary of a vibrant world economy.index funds are about as plain-vanilla an investment as you can get. they throw out the fund manager and just try to mirror the results of a stock index. because they aren't actively managed, they can limit expenses to a bare minimum. those low costs let you keep more money in your account.you can buy index funds that invest in large companies, small companies and everything in between. but large-company index funds, such as those that track the s&p 500 or the russell 1000, are particularly compelling now, even though the s&p 500 has gained a stronger-than-average 7% this year, assuming dividends were reinvested. here are three reasons to move part of your 401(k) to a large-cap index fund now:*price. the s&p 500 index now sells for about 16  times its estimated 2007 earnings -- about its long-term average. (the price- earnings ratio shows how cheap a stock is, relative to earnings. the lower the p-e, the cheaper the stock or stock index.) by contrast, the s&p smallcap 600 index has a considerably higher p-e: about 19.7 times its estimated 2007 earnings.bargain-hunter wallace weitz, manager of weitz partners fund, notes that many stocks that were darlings of the 1990s bull market are still languishing. case in point: wal-mart, the retail giant that is selling for about the same price that it did eight years ago. in the meantime, its earnings have more than doubled. ""i'd say it was overvalued then, but it's undervalued now,"" weitz says.in addition, the forces that have driven up small-company stocks might not last. small companies have been the darlings of wall street since about 2000, when the bull market in large-company stocks turned into an epic bear market. after seven years, though, the surge in small-cap stocks is starting to look a bit old, says larry puglia, manager of t. rowe price blue chip growth fund.""it's a longer cycle than we typically see,"" puglia says.one reason for the longevity of the bull market for small-cap stocks: a flurry of buyouts, particularly from private-equity firms, has kept small-company stock prices rising. but if the buyout boom falters, small-company stocks could falter.*momentum. it's a curious fact that on wall street, as in physics, objects in motion tend to continue in motion. recently, large-company stocks have picked up a bit of steam. the s&p 500, for example, outperformed its comparable small-cap and midcap indexes in the second quarter.*globalization. ""we're seeing strong economic growth in europe and asia, and the s&p 500 companies are getting about 45% of their sales there,"" says alec young, equity analyst for s&p. the boom in sales abroad, young says, made up for any weakness in the u.s. market in the first half of the year.strong overseas sales boost corporate earnings, and so does the dollar's fall on international currency markets. example: say a company earned 1 million euros 12 months ago. at $1.28 per euro, that equals nearly $1.3 million. but a euro is now worth $1.36. so 1 million euros in overseas earnings now equals nearly $1.4 million.large-caps could also fare well if investors sense an economic slowdown. typically, investors flee to large-caps when the financial world seems uncertain.finally, while any rise in interest rates will hurt stocks of any size, it will hurt small-company stocks the most. that's because small companies are most dependent on borrowing to fuel growth. larger companies can typically manage their borrowing and spending to reduce the ill effects of higher rates.because the s&p 500 closely mirrors the performance of large- company stocks, an s&p 500 index fund is a logical place to put the stock portion of your 401(k) money now. because of their low expenses, these funds have outperformed the average managed fund over the long term.if you don't want to miss out on any lingering small-cap rallies, there's another option, too: an index fund that mirrors the total stock market.these funds typically mirror a very broad index, such as the russell 3000 or the s&p 1500 supercomposite. they're weighted by capitalization -- market price multiplied by number of shares outstanding -- so you'll still own a big dose of large-cap stocks. (large-company stocks make up about 87% of the s&p 1500, young says.) yet you'll also enjoy a boost if small-company stocks continue to soar.graphic, b/w, adrienne lewis, usa today, source: ibbotson & associates; graphics, b/w, source: lipper (chart) (5)",Standard & Poors Corp

1825336436,Los Angeles Times,2016-10-04,News,Main News; Part A; Metro Desk,Rape,A.1,1432,Should a rape accuser remain anonymous?; The civil case against NBA's Derrick Rose poses a legal dilemma.,"her lawsuit alleging she was raped by nba star derrick rose has made national headlines.the new york knicks point guard has been dogged by questions about her claim during preseason appearances. and she recently gave a lengthy interview with reporters during a conference call about the case.but since she filed suit against rose a year ago, the woman identified in court filings only as ""jane doe"" has remained anonymous.that secrecy is about to end.a federal judge has ruled that once the case goes to trial, the 30-year-old will have to be named. barring a last-minute settlement, jury selection will begin tuesday.the case is the latest to raise a persistent legal and ethical dilemma: should the accuser in a rape case have the right to remain anonymous in court?the woman at the center of the lawsuit argued that her identity should be kept secret because she fears rose's fans would harass and possibly harm her and her family if her name became known.rose and the other men have not been criminally charged, although los angeles police say they continue to investigate the case after the woman filed a complaint last year -- two years after the alleged 2013 rape.u.s. district judge michael w. fitzgerald ruled that the plaintiff could remain anonymous during pretrial proceedings, but not during the trial itself. in so doing, he sought a middle ground between conflicting legal principles.""the public does, of course, have some interest in [her] true identity, especially in light of the publicity surrounding this action,"" fitzgerald wrote. ""the public has an equally strong interest, however, in encouraging victims of sexual assault to bring claims against their assailants.""judges have often allowed people who brought civil cases involving rape allegations or other highly sensitive matters to keep their identities cloaked at trial. perhaps the most notable is the landmark abortion rights case roe vs. wade, in which the plaintiff was known as jane roe. and in a case frequently cited by judges and lawyers, the federal appeals court in california allowed a group of immigrant garment workers to sue their employer anonymously because of deportation concerns.but usually, federal judges insist that the parties in a lawsuit be identified at trial, experts said. attempts to shield information presented in court from public view must be weighed against the longstanding principle that shining a light on the workings of the judiciary guards against injustice, incompetence or fraud.""for the most part, judges have been reluctant to allow pseudonyms, because they're afraid of violating this very fundamental tenet of judicial openness,"" said jayne ressler, a professor at brooklyn law school who has studied the question of anonymity in courts.ressler said many states, including california, readily grant anonymity to rape victims in criminal proceedings, but those protections do not necessarily carry over into civil trials.in a similar case, a 27-year-old woman also using the pseudonym jane doe filed a lawsuit two years ago in washington, d.c., accusing cincinnati reds pitcher alfredo simon cabrera of rape. a federal court judge ruled that she could remain anonymous only until the trial. the case was dismissed at her request late last year.the tendency of civil court judges to favor openness when it comes to rape claims frustrates ressler and others, such as meg garvin, executive director of the national crime victim law institute. allowing a woman to go through trial as a jane doe does little to reduce a court's transparency, they said, whereas exposing her identity harms her and discourages future victims of sexual assault from coming forward.""the name doesn't matter. what's important is what happened. did the man rape this woman?"" ressler said.the speed with which information now spreads through social media raises the stakes. while most mainstream media outlets generally do not name accusers in rape cases, people posting to online platforms are not bound by such rules.the case involving rose, who was for many years a marquee player with the chicago bulls until a recent trade to new york, has provided a particularly stark example of the conflict between privacy and openness. despite a career beset by injuries, rose, the youngest player ever to win the nba's most valuable player award, has built a huge fan base, as evidenced by his 2.45 million twitter followers.rose and two friends, randall hampton and ryan allen, are accused in the lawsuit of sexually assaulting the woman in the early morning hours one day in august 2013. rose and the woman had been in a relationship for a few years, and on the night in question, the woman has recounted, she went to a party with rose, who was living temporarily in los angeles.the woman alleges that afterward, while drinking at rose's house, the men secretly drugged her. hours later, after she had departed, the men drove to the woman's apartment. the woman alleges the men sexually assaulted her while she was in an ""incapacitated state of consciousness.""rose and the others acknowledge they had sex with the woman, but say it was consensual.the woman sued in los angeles county superior court. rose's lawyers successfully petitioned to move the case to federal district court, saying rose was not a resident of california.the months of legal wrangling in the lead-up to trial have often been ugly. rose's attorney, mark baute, has taken a pugnacious approach, saying the woman's demand for $21 million shows she is trying to shake down rose.""this is not a rape case. it's pure and simple extortion by a plaintiff who wants to hide behind the cloak of anonymity while seeking millions in damages from a celebrity,"" baute wrote in one of many filings.baute forced the issue of the woman's anonymity, arguing in june that the case should be dismissed or the woman be forced to identify herself because rose had been badly disadvantaged by her hidden identity. baute said she had given up her claim to anonymity because she had posted provocative photos of herself using her name online.baute declined to comment on the issue of the woman's anonymity.her attorney, brandon anand, did not respond to requests for comment.fitzgerald rejected baute's arguments, finding that rose's fame heightened the likelihood that identifying the woman ""could subject her to significant harassment and humiliation from the public."" and the judge admonished baute for citing the woman's online photos in his argument, saying they made her no less deserving of protection.""defendant rose,"" the judge wrote, ""appears to suggest that women who publicly portray themselves as 'sexual' are less likely to experience embarrassment, humiliation and harassment associated with gang rape. such rhetoric has no place in this court.""in his ruling, fitzgerald cited the 2003 sex assault case against los angeles lakers star kobe bryant, who was accused by a 19-year-old colorado hotel worker of raping her while she was at work at a mountain resort.despite efforts by the judge in those criminal proceedings to conceal her identity, the woman endured harassment and threats when her name was leaked and spread widely.in his ruling last month, however, fitzgerald wrote that ""as trial approaches, the public's interest in disclosure also increases."" it is well-established, he explained, that open courtrooms are an important element of journalists' and the general public's constitutional right to free speech. keeping the woman's name secret, he said, would risk impinging on those rights.the judge added a second reason for his ruling. if jurors heard the woman referred to as jane doe, they might infer she was being protected because of harm caused by the defendants.the woman's attorney made a last-ditch effort last week to get the judge to reconsider, filing a letter from a los angeles police detective who said she was actively investigating the rape allegation for possible criminal charges and would like the woman's identity to remain secret while the inquiry continued.in the same filing, on which fitzgerald has not ruled, the attorney also submitted screen grabs from social media sites on which people discussed the case and named the woman, denigrating her decision to sue rose. one post dismissed her as a ""gold digger.""the harassment, the woman's lawyer argued, would probably worsen if the woman's identity was made public in court.caption: photo: in the lawsuit, derrick rose

""we hold the event each weekend after the lunar new year day,"" yeung said.according to the chinese zodiac, each new year is ruled by one of 12 animals -- rat, tiger, rabbit, dragon, snake, dog, horse, sheep, rooster, pig, monkey and ox. this year is ruled by the rabbit. for the vietnamese community, celebrating tet, it's the year of the cat.at the corner of college street and broadway, a parking lot was converted into a food court with a staging area. there, the air was mixed with the scent of barbecue smoke and fireworks. dance groups and singers performed on stage while people sat at tables eating egg rolls, plates of barbecue and pad thai.""everyone brings in their own culture here,"" said may chiang, the entertainment organizer. the tiny district, she said, also has populations from vietnam, taiwan and other areas of southeast asia.nearby, citlalli cuevas, 27, wandered along the white tents with her 6-year-old daughter, jimena, who was dressed up as a white rabbit. cuevas said she moved to los angeles from mexico more than a year ago because of her husband's new job. she learned about saturday's event through the internet and her daughter's school.""i thought it would be fun to bring her here,"" cuevas said, looking down at her daughter.

408986117,USA TODAY,2006-07-26,Feature,LIFE,Trees,D.1,1662,Treehouses lovely as a poem ; New designs go out on a whim,"rowe, n.m. -- so where does an intense actor like val kilmer, known for disappearing into emotionally toxic roles such as jim morrison, go to find himself?the answer is found up a steep embankment of loose shale that snakes alongside the lazy pecos river. there, five oak trees embrace a cocoon of wood and tin, one artist's rendition of that most iconic of childhood getaways: the treehouse.""i'll fib and say it's for my kids, but it's really for me,"" says kilmer, 46, flashing that famous army of white teeth, his blond locks  buzzed for his just-wrapped role in the upcoming cbs miniseries comanche moon. ""i had a treehouse as a child. so being an adult  ... well, it's strangely, weirdly satisfying to sit in a tree.""it doesn't hurt that kilmer's trees sit on a 6,000-acre ranch so remote that one of his nearest neighbors, jane fonda, is a long hawk's flight away. but such epic real estate isn't required to experience the escapist magic  of communing with birds' nests.from funky new york gardens to manicured california backyards, the treehouse is newly in vogue as homeowners seek to either reclaim their youth or provide children with at-home fun. or both. and while a dad with a hammer  can  do the job, many are calling on a small number of specialized builders who give the tree its say and can charge lofty sums for the privilege.what's workable is whatever is imaginable. while some treehouses remain little more than airy clubhouses in the clouds, others boast beds, crown molding, fireplaces and just about any other comfort from shelters  on terra firma. the add-on that's added up.""two reasons treehouses have become more popular,"" says roderick romero, a new york   treehouse builder to the stars, including kilmer. ""first, they provide wonderful relief in these fast-paced, stressed-out times, and second, the structures themselves can now be built very safe, so they'll support all ages and last nearly forever.""specifically, the development of a steel support called the garnier limb, or gl, lets trees bear weights far beyond what they could without the device, allowing for veritable mini-mansions to sprout from backyard trees.the considerable cost of building in trees means it's largely the rich and famous who are pushing the genre's envelope. many of them have come to romero. his eclectic essence -- he's a fully tattooed yoga fanatic with two braids that reach his waist -- has endeared him to the likes of sting, donna karan and julianne moore, for whom he has built treehouses in italy, long island and manhattan, respectively.romero discreetly says his fee ""varies,"" but his creations were trumpeted last year as one of the  neiman marcus christmas catalog's fantasy gifts, priced at $50,000 or more. emphasis on more.while romero's work so far largely has appealed to kids in adult bodies, san francisco-based treehouse builder barbara butler  is on a mission  ""to get kids out of the house and away from air conditioning, carpeting and computers.""though  known for fanciful ground-based play structures that can exceed $200,000, her  passion is  putting children  up high  in trees.""growing up, i'd be gone all day and home by dark,"" she says. ""today, the world's different.  so if the family yard is where time is spent now, why not help make those encounters come to life  in a treehouse that's both artistic and sturdy?""meg burnham of santa barbara has just hired butler to help get her young grandkids  off the ground on her 187-acre estate. ""we're thinking of having  a ship in one tree with a rope ladder that will lead to  the next one,""  she says.scurrying up trunks is in our genes, dating to the days when early humans sought to escape predators that couldn't climb, says david greenberg, curator of treehouses in paradise, a playful exhibit of 100 treehouse designs  that runs through july 31 at the pacific design center in los angeles.""what you see is that this treehouse fantasy is something the whole world relates to,"" says greenberg, whose own projects have been built as far away as china. ""women may see trees as romantic, while guys sometimes do the tarzan thing. but we all connect with them in some way.""evidence of that can be found in treehouses of the world by pete nelson,  a partner in the seattle-based construction firm treehouse workshop. nelson's book showcases such madcap designs  as the ewok treehouse in oxfordshire, england. (think star wars meets edward scissorhands.)""some folks ask for kitchens and bathrooms, but at that point i start to lose some interest, because you're moving away from what the treehouse is all about,"" says nelson, whose projects average $80,000 for 200 square feet, some insulation and a few electrical outlets. ""but this is definitely gaining momentum.""  revenue at treehouse workshop has increased by 20% a year during the past three years.""we're  seeing more builders at our seminars and getting more photos each week"" from people showing off their backyard babies.although clients often have elaborate ideas, experienced  builders say it's important to let mother nature do some of the talking.""the  key  is to come to the land without any preconceived ideas,"" romero says. ""you want to see what the trees tell you to build.""that certainly was the approach kilmer wanted romero to take when he arrived here in early july.initially a lone ponderosa pine beckoned, but romero was concerned both for his own safety -- the house would have sat some 40 feet above the river -- and natural aesthetics. ""that tree was perfect the way it was. it wasn't asking for a house in it,"" he says.but about 30 yards away, a stand of five oaks clung bravely to an almost sheer rock face. romero imagined a ""little house that would look like it had fallen from the mesa above and gotten stuck in these five trees."" kilmer loved the idea.wood for the project was sourced from a decaying 100-year-old barn, metal from local salvage yards.  ""i want to do everything here in an ecologically friendly way,"" says kilmer, who eight years ago purchased this spread, once owned by actress greer garson.kilmer eventually will ""build a new house here by the river, have some organic gardens to farm what i need and just get back to the land. in a way, this treehouse is my first step in that direction.""kilmer has lived in the wilds of northern new mexico for 20 years, going back to his breakthrough role in top gun (1986). he even got married in the area, to now ex-wife joanne whalley.the couple's two children, mercedes, 14, and jack, 11, live with their actress mother in l.a. kilmer clearly delights in them; the dash  of his beat-up land rover sports an array of graffiti, including ""jack rocks"" and ""mercedes rules.""he hopes the treehouse will be a magnet for their attention.""they haven't seen this place yet, but i can't wait,"" says kilmer, lying on the treehouse deck in shorts and a sweat-soaked khaki shirt. ""my son's a monkey. he'll be up on that tin roof in no time.""if dad doesn't get there first, that is. though the structure has been up only a few weeks, kilmer has bonded with it. he credits both an inherent familial connection -- a distant cousin, poet joyce kilmer, is famous for his poem trees -- and a need to decompress. ""my business is very self-oriented and takes enormous energy, so any chance to truly get away is welcome.""kilmer talks mostly in sentence fragments,  a shifting cadence that's  in sync with life's whimsical pace here.  the horses whinny and dart, only to suddenly stand still in a patch of shade. the river mostly glides though canyons etched eons ago, but occasionally accelerates over rocks in a rapid rush.and up in a treehouse sits not a movie star, but a man momentarily whisked back to childhood.put another way: kilmer could live in the grandest of mansions, yet he seems more at home in a  300-square-foot platform in the sky.""look at this tree. it's so solid and yet so fragile that it moves with the wind,"" he says, grasping one of the oaks. ""there's a sense of freedom and wonderment up here.""a fast-moving afternoon storm starts to lay siege. within minutes, rain drops are pounding the treehouse's tin roof while lightning zigzags ominously nearby. and kilmer is going exactly nowhere.""in places like this,"" he says, ""i can figure out what i'm all about.""tips for would-be buildersso you have a tree. but are you a candidate for a treehouse?treehouse designer and builder roderick romero says people who consider this sylvan architectural adventure should keep in mind:*tree type. ""the harder the better,"" he says. oak, ficus and banyan are his preferences.*location. build as far from the main house as possible. ""aim to disguise the creation as best you can, so it just fades away into nature,"" using the contours of the tree to dictate shape and incorporating downed tree limbs in its construction.*recycling. use reclaimed materials when possible, ""so you're not celebrating one tree in your backyard at the expense of one that was chopped down in the amazon.""*expertise. ""hire people who've built treehouses before, and that's not meant to be an ad for me,"" romero says, laughing. ""your trees will thank you, and you'll keep the treehouse longer.""photos, color, robert hanashiro, usa today (2); photo, b/w, robert hanashiro, usa today",

2293461759,New York Times,2019-09-20,Review,C,Art galleries & museums,C.13,1523,A Rebellion Brought Into Focus,"alvin baltrop's photographs of the abandoned hudson river piers and the people who populated them in the 1970s and '80s have been all but ignored. until now.new york city is a gateway for fresh art talent but it's also an archive of art careers past. some are visible, in the ""active"" file. most are buried deep. a few surface only after artists have departed, as is the case with the american photographer alvin baltrop, who was unknown to the mainstream art world when he died in 2004 at 55, and who now has a bright, tough monument of a retrospective at the bronx museum of the arts.the show, ""the life and times of alvin baltrop,"" is also a monument to new york itself during the 1970s and '80s, when mr. baltrop did his major work. during those decades, the city was physically falling apart. at the same time, it radiated creative energy. among other things, in the wake of the 1969 stonewall uprising, it was home base for a new gay consciousness.disintegration and rebellion dovetailed in a line of derelict shipping piers that stretched the hudson river between chelsea and greenwich village. isolated from the rest of the city after the collapse of the southernmost section of the elevated west side highway, the piers became a preserve for gay sex and communion, and the primary subject of mr. baltrop's surviving photographs. these include architectural studies of the piers, but also shots of their semi-residential population of homeless people, teenage runaways, sexual adventurers, criminals and artists, a company that mr. baltrop, in effect, joined.at a glance, he might have seemed an outsider to the adjacent west village world. bronx-born, working-class, african-american, bisexual, he came to the scene directly from a three-year stint as a navy medic. the earliest pictures in the show, which has been organized by antonio sergio bessa, director of curatorial and education programs at the bronx museum, were taken aboard the destroyer william k. pratt, where he was stationed at the height of the vietnam war.some shots are of the ship itself as a functioning war machine, which, although it never actually went to southeast asia during mr. baltrop's time, kept its crew busy with on-deck drills. far more interesting and experimental are images of domestic life at sea: sailors sunbathing; napping on deck, and rubbing shoulders in tight living quarters. and most daring, are dramatically posed and lighted studies of nude male bodies: torsos, buttocks, genitals. in these images, the mood is erotic without being furtive. these are clearly collaborations with willing models.after discharge from the service, mr. baltrop returned to new york city, where he lived on the lower east side with a woman named alice and made a living as a taxi driver. by this point, just a few years after stonewall, the piers had become the main stage for an openly expressed gay sexuality, and they drew mr. baltrop in. initially he used his flexible hours as a cabby to visit and photograph them. then, to gain more time, he quit driving, bought a van and, supporting himself as a freelance mover, camped there for days and nights on end.there's no question that he considered his photographs -- particularly of pier 52, then located at the end of gansevoort street, just beyond where the whitney museum of american art now stands -- a long-term project, a mix of historical documentation, insider anthropology, and autobiography. life on the piers, with its definable demographic and culture of confinement, was not so different from that on board a ship, and mr. baltrop viewed it both from afar and up close. the more than 200 pictures in the bronx show are very much about pulling back for the broad view, then zeroing in.he was careful to give the piers a context. he shot the waterfront neighborhood with its bars (the ramrod, badlands, the stud), its transient hotels, and its commercial truck parking lots (which also served as nocturnal trysting places). and he photographed, at varying distances, the abandoned shipping depots and warehouse sheds on the piers themselves.as a group, these images are invaluable contributions to american urban visual history, but also to art history. a lot of new art was happening on the piers. in 1975, the new york artist gordon matta-clark sliced a huge crescent-shaped, light flooded hole in a west-facing wall on pier 52 and titled it ""day's end""; a painter named tava (gustav von will) was doing murals, as were younger contemporaries like mike bidlo and david wojnarowicz. mr. baltrop recorded some of this work, though it seemed incidental to his true interest. what really gripped him was the grandeur and danger of structural ruin, and the people who occupied it.look closely at his panoramic views of pier exteriors and you'll see, in many, the presence of tiny figures, clothed or nude, leaning from windows, lounging around, having sex. and the majority of his shots were of populated interiors. in pier 52, he used a homemade version of a window-cleaner's harness to suspend himself from the ceiling and survey activities below. at the same time, because he became a regular, unthreatening presence, he was able to photograph on-the-ground action, much of it sexual, from an intimate vantage.the piers were not benign places, and mr. baltrop knew it. muggings were common. murders happened. he took chilling pictures of the police fishing bodies from the hudson. (one locally famous waterfront habitué, the drag queen and activist marsha p. johnson, of whom mr. baltrop made a wonderful portrait, was found dead in the river in 1992.) he spoke, later in his life, of ""the frightening, mad, unbelievable, violent, beautiful things that were going on"" at the piers. he was aware that his own attraction to them had a pathological element. ""it became an addiction,"" he said. ""it was like a drug. it was a drug.""yet you find little sense of menace in the photographs, most of which are black and white, with a few in color. raw, cavernous interiors have a church-like luminosity. and, despite repeated images of bare flesh the work can feel erotic but chaste, the way thomas eakins's paintings of adolescent boys at a swimming hole do. much has been made of the ""classical"" poise of explicitly sexual images by baltrop's celebrated contemporaries peter hujar and robert mapplethorpe. but mr. baltrop's a classicist too, just a less self-conscious one.so why has he been all but ignored until fairly recently? again, his outsider status as a queer working-class african-american is a big part of the answer. (he had two small shows, one in a bar where he moonlighted as a bouncer, but one gallery owner who saw the pictures referred to him as ""a real sewer rat type""; another accused him of stealing work by a white photographer.) fortunately, toward the end of his life, he met the painter randal wilcox, who immediately saw the value of his photography and, after mr. baltrop's death from cancer in 2004, rescued it from what could easily have been obliteration.in addition to a cache of personal items -- identity cards, medical records, cameras -- that are in the bronx show, mr. baltrop left behind a handful of beat-up photographic prints and thousands of rolls of film that he couldn't afford to have processed. in 2008, an artforum essay by the writer and curator douglas crimp (reprinted in the exhibition catalog) put mr. baltrop's name into circulation, and his reputation continues to grow. this fall his work will be included in the rehang of the museum of modern art's permanent collection. he's also in the whitney's collection. (on the site of pier 52, which served for more than a decade as his studio and sometime home, a public art project by the artist david hammons, organized by the whitney and the hudson river park trust, began construction this week.)mr. baltrop himself might well be hard pressed today to recognize the part of the city he once recorded. among the show's latest images is one of a pier engulfed in flames and smoke. the picture may well date from around 1986, when the ""sex piers"" began to be demolished by the city, to be replaced by the luxury condos, entertainment centers and the transplanted uptown museum there today. it's gratifying to think of mr. baltrop, brilliant, persistent, and fully resurrected in the bronx show, as the true phoenix arising from the ashes.the life and times of alvin baltropthrough feb. 9 at the bronx museum of the arts, 1040 grand concourse; 718-681-6000, bronxmuseum.org.the life and times of alvin baltrop through feb. 9 at the bronx museum of the arts; 718-681-6000, bronxmuseum.org.",Bronx Museum of the Arts-New York City NY

""these students have free speech rights.""the fraternity organizer, pascal de maria, now a senior, said he did not believe anti-semitism was involved.chapman spokeswoman mary platt said the letter was under review and that some student contentions were untrue, such as being prohibited from wearing fraternity t-shirts.""they've been wearing those shirts all semester. there has been no action taken. that's ridiculous,"" she said. ""the university's only aim throughout all this is to assure that this group, as with any group, does not call itself an officially sanctioned chapman organization when it's not, because . . . it leaves the university with considerable liability.""the controversy's roots are more than 2 years old, when de maria and some friends decided to create a campus chapter of sigma alpha mu, a historically jewish fraternity. the students began recruiting members and meeting with university officials in spring 2005 about the application process. in april 2006, the university allowed a fraternity to set up on campus but turned down several, including sigma alpha mu.at the same time, the group's national organization gave the students ""colony"" status, a step below chapter status, and the chapman students began wearing t-shirts emblazoned with the greek letters on campus.in september 2006, joseph kertes and administrator chris hutchinson sent de maria a letter ordering him to stop advertising fraternity events on campus and forbade him to hold fraternity events on campus or meeting at chapman before heading to off-campus events.they also said the group must clearly indicate that it is not affiliated with chapman and request that the national organization send a letter to university officials stating that there is no chapter at the campus, and to agree to carry insurance coverage for chapman students who associate with the local fraternity.the letter was sent to several administrators, as well as the leaders of the university's sanctioned fraternities and sororities.chapman also sent leaders of these groups letters urging them to report to university officials if de maria or the other sigma alpha mu members were seen congregating on campus or wearing their t- shirts, villagra said.""i felt like a prisoner at the school i go to,"" de maria said.platt said she could not comment on the september 2006 letter because it would violate de maria's privacy rights.the university's decision to distribute the letter to other students is the subject of a complaint de maria filed with the federal government.she said the group was offered the option of becoming a school club, which is a much simpler process than becoming a fraternity.the only difference is that the group would have to admit any man or woman who applied, she said.the aclu letter does not question the university's decision to deny the group its imprimatur but seeks a retraction of the restrictions in the september 2006 letter, as well as expunging students' records of anything relating to the fraternity issue.villagra said that the restrictions were applied only to sigma alpha mu and not to any other unauthorized group that claims a chapman affiliation, such as the assn. of intellegentpot smokers and the under age drinkers (cu chapter), both of which assert school affiliation on their facebook pages.platt said university officials lacked the resources to police the internet.villagra said if the university failed to act, the aclu would consider suing.de maria said he would be happy if his group could do what other fraternal groups do -- play ultimate frisbee on the quad and hold meetings, charity benefits and social events.""we have no intention of making the university angry or provoking them,"" he said.""we really just wanted to associate ourselves with a brotherhood.""",

""sen. kerry and teresa are both practicing catholics who regularly attend mass. what we don't do is what president bush has done, which is to get church membership lists and get church organizations to conduct the effort.""critics of christian conservatives say heinz kerry's remarks ring true about some elements of the movement; they point, for example, to comments made by jerry falwell, who suggested that gays, abortion- rights supporters and liberal civil rights activists were partly to blame for the sept. 11 attacks.""there is an element of the right wing that is motivated by religious extremists who promote intolerance,"" said steven fisher, communications director for human rights campaign, which promotes gay, lesbian and transgender equal rights. ""but there is also strong support in religious communities for tolerance, even where they don't support gay marriage. it isn't fair to say that jerry falwell represents all the christian religious communities.""john c. green, a political science professor at the university of akron in ohio, said heinz kerry's rhetoric represented a fairly common criticism of the christian right during the 1980s, although it had begun to moderate by the 1990s when the christian movement presented itself with a less strident face.such criticism today is fraught with peril, green noted. ""it takes a deft politician to hit the activists in the christian right and not hit the people who are simply strong in their christian values."" he said that 1994 was a year when the democratic congressional campaign committee criticized the christian right, a decision that partly explained the strong gains republicans made in congressional races that year.alison renteln, a political science professor at usc, said the context of heinz kerry's speech about pressures for conformity represent a fair evaluation of american culture. renteln wrote a book, ""cultural defense"" that examined the unwillingness of courts to admit evidence about differing cultural values.at the time heinz kerry attacked the movement, she was a registered republican in pennsylvania and played an influential role in the state party, but she had espoused support for moderate causes in her speeches and her philanthropic agenda.the 1994 speech came during the tough senate race that pitted sen. rick santorum (r-pa.), against then incumbent sen. harris wofford, a democrat who had won sen. heinz's seat in a special election after his death.during the campaign, santorum got into a tiff with heinz kerry, who had considered entering the senate race herself. heinz kerry called santorum ""forrest gump with an attitude"" and said he was ""short of public service and even shorter on accomplishments.""santorum suggested that heinz kerry was being influenced by kerry, and said that her late husband would have supported his campaign. santorum is closely aligned with the christian right. he declined to comment thursday.",Democratic Party

1825336436,Los Angeles Times,2016-10-04,News,Main News; Part A; Metro Desk,Rape,A.1,1432,Should a rape accuser remain anonymous?; The civil case against NBA's Derrick Rose poses a legal dilemma.,"her lawsuit alleging she was raped by nba star derrick rose has made national headlines.the new york knicks point guard has been dogged by questions about her claim during preseason appearances. and she recently gave a lengthy interview with reporters during a conference call about the case.but since she filed suit against rose a year ago, the woman identified in court filings only as ""jane doe"" has remained anonymous.that secrecy is about to end.a federal judge has ruled that once the case goes to trial, the 30-year-old will have to be named. barring a last-minute settlement, jury selection will begin tuesday.the case is the latest to raise a persistent legal and ethical dilemma: should the accuser in a rape case have the right to remain anonymous in court?the woman at the center of the lawsuit argued that her identity should be kept secret because she fears rose's fans would harass and possibly harm her and her family if her name became known.rose and the other men have not been criminally charged, although los angeles police say they continue to investigate the case after the woman filed a complaint last year -- two years after the alleged 2013 rape.u.s. district judge michael w. fitzgerald ruled that the plaintiff could remain anonymous during pretrial proceedings, but not during the trial itself. in so doing, he sought a middle ground between conflicting legal principles.""the public does, of course, have some interest in [her] true identity, especially in light of the publicity surrounding this action,"" fitzgerald wrote. ""the public has an equally strong interest, however, in encouraging victims of sexual assault to bring claims against their assailants.""judges have often allowed people who brought civil cases involving rape allegations or other highly sensitive matters to keep their identities cloaked at trial. perhaps the most notable is the landmark abortion rights case roe vs. wade, in which the plaintiff was known as jane roe. and in a case frequently cited by judges and lawyers, the federal appeals court in california allowed a group of immigrant garment workers to sue their employer anonymously because of deportation concerns.but usually, federal judges insist that the parties in a lawsuit be identified at trial, experts said. attempts to shield information presented in court from public view must be weighed against the longstanding principle that shining a light on the workings of the judiciary guards against injustice, incompetence or fraud.""for the most part, judges have been reluctant to allow pseudonyms, because they're afraid of violating this very fundamental tenet of judicial openness,"" said jayne ressler, a professor at brooklyn law school who has studied the question of anonymity in courts.ressler said many states, including california, readily grant anonymity to rape victims in criminal proceedings, but those protections do not necessarily carry over into civil trials.in a similar case, a 27-year-old woman also using the pseudonym jane doe filed a lawsuit two years ago in washington, d.c., accusing cincinnati reds pitcher alfredo simon cabrera of rape. a federal court judge ruled that she could remain anonymous only until the trial. the case was dismissed at her request late last year.the tendency of civil court judges to favor openness when it comes to rape claims frustrates ressler and others, such as meg garvin, executive director of the national crime victim law institute. allowing a woman to go through trial as a jane doe does little to reduce a court's transparency, they said, whereas exposing her identity harms her and discourages future victims of sexual assault from coming forward.""the name doesn't matter. what's important is what happened. did the man rape this woman?"" ressler said.the speed with which information now spreads through social media raises the stakes. while most mainstream media outlets generally do not name accusers in rape cases, people posting to online platforms are not bound by such rules.the case involving rose, who was for many years a marquee player with the chicago bulls until a recent trade to new york, has provided a particularly stark example of the conflict between privacy and openness. despite a career beset by injuries, rose, the youngest player ever to win the nba's most valuable player award, has built a huge fan base, as evidenced by his 2.45 million twitter followers.rose and two friends, randall hampton and ryan allen, are accused in the lawsuit of sexually assaulting the woman in the early morning hours one day in august 2013. rose and the woman had been in a relationship for a few years, and on the night in question, the woman has recounted, she went to a party with rose, who was living temporarily in los angeles.the woman alleges that afterward, while drinking at rose's house, the men secretly drugged her. hours later, after she had departed, the men drove to the woman's apartment. the woman alleges the men sexually assaulted her while she was in an ""incapacitated state of consciousness.""rose and the others acknowledge they had sex with the woman, but say it was consensual.the woman sued in los angeles county superior court. rose's lawyers successfully petitioned to move the case to federal district court, saying rose was not a resident of california.the months of legal wrangling in the lead-up to trial have often been ugly. rose's attorney, mark baute, has taken a pugnacious approach, saying the woman's demand for $21 million shows she is trying to shake down rose.""this is not a rape case. it's pure and simple extortion by a plaintiff who wants to hide behind the cloak of anonymity while seeking millions in damages from a celebrity,"" baute wrote in one of many filings.baute forced the issue of the woman's anonymity, arguing in june that the case should be dismissed or the woman be forced to identify herself because rose had been badly disadvantaged by her hidden identity. baute said she had given up her claim to anonymity because she had posted provocative photos of herself using her name online.baute declined to comment on the issue of the woman's anonymity.her attorney, brandon anand, did not respond to requests for comment.fitzgerald rejected baute's arguments, finding that rose's fame heightened the likelihood that identifying the woman ""could subject her to significant harassment and humiliation from the public."" and the judge admonished baute for citing the woman's online photos in his argument, saying they made her no less deserving of protection.""defendant rose,"" the judge wrote, ""appears to suggest that women who publicly portray themselves as 'sexual' are less likely to experience embarrassment, humiliation and harassment associated with gang rape. such rhetoric has no place in this court.""in his ruling, fitzgerald cited the 2003 sex assault case against los angeles lakers star kobe bryant, who was accused by a 19-year-old colorado hotel worker of raping her while she was at work at a mountain resort.despite efforts by the judge in those criminal proceedings to conceal her identity, the woman endured harassment and threats when her name was leaked and spread widely.in his ruling last month, however, fitzgerald wrote that ""as trial approaches, the public's interest in disclosure also increases."" it is well-established, he explained, that open courtrooms are an important element of journalists' and the general public's constitutional right to free speech. keeping the woman's name secret, he said, would risk impinging on those rights.the judge added a second reason for his ruling. if jurors heard the woman referred to as jane doe, they might infer she was being protected because of harm caused by the defendants.the woman's attorney made a last-ditch effort last week to get the judge to reconsider, filing a letter from a los angeles police detective who said she was actively investigating the rape allegation for possible criminal charges and would like the woman's identity to remain secret while the inquiry continued.in the same filing, on which fitzgerald has not ruled, the attorney also submitted screen grabs from social media sites on which people discussed the case and named the woman, denigrating her decision to sue rose. one post dismissed her as a ""gold digger.""the harassment, the woman's lawyer argued, would probably worsen if the woman's identity was made public in court.caption: photo: in the lawsuit, derrick rose

2149891732,Washington Post The,2018-12-02,News,A-SECTION,Public prosecutors,A.2,1087,Mueller's probe unearths liars surrounding Trump,"as special counsel robert s. mueller iii moves toward the summation of his investigation - and whatever his eventual report produces - there is no escaping the sleaze factor that existed around president trump before and during his campaign for the white house in 2016.it was there in the presence of paul manafort, who arrived at the campaign in the spring of 2016 and lasted until embarrassing and continued disclosures about his past work with pro-russian officials in ukraine forced him to step aside, and whose recent plea agreement was tossed out this past week because prosecutors say he has continued to lie to them.it was there in the presence of michael cohen, trump's longtime personal lawyer and fixer, who did the deals and arranged the payoffs that were designed to suppress damaging allegations about trump and other women during the final months of the campaign and whose new guilty plea about lying to congress has put renewed focus on the president's words and actions.it was there in the presence of roger stone, a practitioner of the dark arts of politics and a one-time business partner with manafort, who acted over the years as a political adviser and confidant to trump and whose apparent knowledge of leaks of emails damaging to hillary clinton's campaign has put him in the crosshairs of the mueller team.it was there in the presence of rick gates, manafort's business partner, who continued in the trump campaign after manafort had departed and who had participated with manafort in a series of fraudulent money-laundering schemes and other escapades that came to light thanks to mueller's team of prosecutors.it was there in the presence of jerome corsi, an inveterate right-wing conspiracy theorist, whose statements to prosecutors about the leaks of democratic and clinton campaign emails via wikileaks produced a draft plea agreement for lying that he ultimately refused to sign, leaving him still dangling for future legal action.it was even there in the presence of george papadopoulos, the low-level foreign policy adviser to the campaign currently serving a two-week prison sentence for lying to federal prosecutors, who sought to leverage his access within the campaign to aggrandize himself in the eyes of foreign diplomats and others.no one yet knows where all this will ultimately lead or when it will end, in terms of the legal jeopardy for these and others who have been caught up in the mueller's web. but the tawdriness factor alone with this rogues' gallery of characters is enough to put the lie to trump's claim of hiring ""only the best"" to advise him in business or government.collectively, you can't make it up. which is why there is again so much focus on the president as central to the investigation. trump has suffered through other bad moments since mueller was appointed to investigate the role russia played in the 2016 election and the degree to which there was cooperation, collusion, conspiracy, advance knowledge or any other kind of involvement by anyone associated with the trump campaign. by any measure, the past week ranks as one of the worst for the president.what is striking at this point, although not a surprise given past histories and the people involved, is the mountain of lying that has taken place. if cohen's admission that he lied to congress is corroborated by additional evidence from materials seized from his office or testimony, the president has long been lying about his business ventures in russia, especially when he was a candidate in 2016 and went soft on russian president vladimir putin. and as cohen's plea makes clear, others have been lying on trump's behalf.as he left the white house on thursday for the group of 20 meeting in argentina, the president said cohen is now lying about having lied to congress. he also said that, even if he did what cohen said, what does it matter? he was a businessman while he was a candidate.rudolph w. giuliani, one of the president's personal legal advisers, has said repeatedly that cohen has lied for years. why did trump keep as his personal lawyer someone whose word was so untrustworthy for so many years? because, trump said, ""a long time ago he did me a favor."" apparently, for trump, a past transaction overrode questions of honesty and integrity in the selection of a personal attorney. is that believable?whether cohen's latest confession contradicts the president's written answers to mueller is, of course, of great interest and importance. mueller and his team know the answer by now.giuliani has said that nothing cohen is now saying contradicts what trump said in his filing to the special counsel. which then begs the question of why trump is accusing cohen of lying now, unless trump's answer to the special counsel about any efforts to make a deal with the russians was so vague, so anodyne, so full of caveats that it could protect him against all contingencies no matter how much cohen's testimony has changed.the web of lies thrown up by the characters who were most prominent in the mueller investigation this past week is difficult to overstate, although perhaps easy to dismiss as typical, given their histories. in any criminal case like this, targets of the prosecutors and some of the eventual witnesses for the prosecution are rarely saints. they come with their own baggage, which must be weighed by jurors.that was the case when gates testified against manafort and was confronted during cross-examination by manafort's lawyers with his own history of lying and fraud. yet in the end, manafort was convicted on most counts in that case, leading him to cut a deal with prosecutors ahead of a second trial, a deal now on the rocks because of more lies.the flurry of activity over the past week has highlighted the various pieces that mueller and his team are working and the degree that they could involve trump directly. the connection is trump and russia. the president's statement to the new york post that a pardon for manafort is not off the table adds to the other element for the investigators to assess.there will be more surprises ahead from the special counsel's office, which must worry those now feeling the glare from the mueller team. there also will be more evidence of lying - which is to be expected given the unsavory band of actors who are at the center of it all.",Congress

433960340,New York Times,2008-10-04,Commentary,A,Peace,A.18,437,Mr. Olmert's Belated Truths,"ehud olmert, israel's soon to be ex-prime minister, voiced some startling truths this week. he said that in exchange for peace, israel should withdraw from ""almost all"" of the west bank and share its capital city, jerusalem, with the palestinians. he also said that as part of a negotiated peace deal with syria, israel should be ready to give up the golan heights.it's frustrating that mr. olmert, who is stepping down as prime minister after being accused of corruption, waited so long to say these things. and it is tragic that he did not do more to act on those beliefs when he had real power.his statements in a farewell interview with the newspaper yediot ahronoth  were unlike anything any israeli political leader had dared to say -- at least publicly -- before. he also dismissed as ""megalomania"" any suggestion that israel should act by itself to destroy iran's nuclear program.there always has been far too wide a gap between mr. olmert's belief that israel's security and demographic survival depends on a two-state solution and what he has been willing to do to get such a deal. the palestinian president, mahmoud abbas, also has not shown nearly enough political courage. the result is that while the two men have been negotiating since the american-led annapolis peace conference last fall, very little progress has been made.there are, of course, many fraught issues to solve: drawing permanent boundaries that give israel defensible frontiers and the palestinians an economically viable state; finding a way for both states to claim jerusalem as their capital; and compensating and resettling palestinian refugees in the new palestinian state.but mr. olmert was never willing to take even the tactical steps needed to improve the lives of ordinary palestinians and give them a real stake in peace: fully freezing the expansion of jewish settlements and sufficiently reducing the roadblocks in the west bank that are strangling the palestinian economy. although a discredited messenger, mr. olmert still deserves credit for putting the most sensitive issues on the table and identifying the only viable formula for a peace agreement.tzipi livni, mr. olmert's designated successor, has been israel's chief negotiator for the past year. it is unlikely that she will show any candor while she tries to put together a coalition government. but we hope that she takes mr. olmert's truths to heart. and we hope she is willing to do what is needed to build a lasting peace.",

""that gives us the window we need to seek a more permanent stay as it goes before the 9th circuit.""gay rights groups hailed walker's decision as a victory, although it disappointed gay couples around the state who had lined up at city halls in hopes of getting married thursday.""it's making the long drive home even more miserable,"" said midge detro, 45, a resident of a town about two hours south of san francisco.she and her partner of 16 years, sandy simmons, awoke at dawn to arrive at san francisco city hall to be among the first to marry on thursday. instead, they filled out forms, had lunch and headed home with plans to return on wednesday.""i just hope they don't try anything next week,"" detro said. ""that's the only scary part of this whole thing.""last week's ruling by walker invalidated proposition 8, a ballot initiative that defined marriage as between a man and a woman. the decision was viewed by both sides as a landmark moment in the battle over same-sex marriage, even though the fight is far from over. the case is widely expected to end up before the supreme court.supporters of proposition 8 had argued that heterosexual marriage is a building block of society because of its role in procreation and that the ballot initiative, which passed in 2008 with 52 percent of the vote, reflected the will of the people.but in a  138-page ruling, walker largely agreed with supporters of same-sex marriage that proposition 8 violates gay  couples' equal rights as outlined in the constitution's 14th amendment.even before walker handed down his decision last week, defenders of proposition 8 had asked for an immediate stay while they pursued an appeal, arguing that allowing same-sex marriages to go forward would cause ""irreparable injury"" to residents of the state. they also said any marriages performed before the case reached its final disposition would be legally questionable.but in thursday's 11-page opinion, walker wrote that the defenders of proposition 8 ""fail to satisfy any of the factors necessary to warrant a stay."" moreover, he questioned whether the lawyers, who come from religious and nonprofit groups, have the legal standing to appeal.neither gov. arnold schwarzenegger (r) nor state attorney general jerry brown (d) agreed to defend proposition 8 in court, and both weighed in on the side of overturning it.walker wrote that it appears ""at least doubtful that proponents will be able to proceed with their appeal without a state defendant."" he denied a stay, he wrote, ""except for a limited time solely in order to permit the court of appeals to consider the issue in an orderly manner.""supporters of same-sex marriage praised the stark language of the opinion and said they regard the delay as a formality.""the court's decision today recognizes that there is no reason to delay allowing gay men and lesbians to enjoy the same rights that virtually all other citizens already enjoy,"" theodore b. olson, one of the two lawyers who led the effort to invalidate proposition 8, said in a statement.",

""it's a transparent run-and-hide strategy by mr. kilgore.""d'amore said the fact that his candidate is on the ballot  --  with more than 24,000 signatures from registered voters in virginia  --  should be enough to prove that he is a legitimate contender.a recent survey of 625 likely voters by mason-dixon polling & research showed potts receiving 9 percent of the vote; kaine got 38 percent and kilgore 37 percent. the poll also found that that 58 percent of respondents wanted to see potts included in the debate.kilgore has maintained that he would not participate in a debate that includes potts, a republican state senator from winchester, because he does not believe potts has a chance of winning the election. kaine has agreed to debate potts, who is running as an independent, and the two have a confirmed appearance scheduled for sept. 30.tim murtaugh, press secretary for the kilgore campaign, said that the decision to debate potts under certain conditions was consistent with kilgore's belief that such forums should be limited to those candidates who have made a significant showing among the state's likely voters.""we have said all along that we would only debate candidates who have a chance of winning,"" murtaugh said. ""if the debate organizers set that bar at 15 percent, then we're willing to accept that.""kaine's campaign said that kilgore was responding to the will of the people in agreeing to the third debate. ""it's clear that voters want to see a debate with all the candidates,"" said mo elleithee, kaine's director of communications. ""it's good to see mr. kilgore come around.""potts could be a threat to both major-party candidates. the mason dixon poll found that much of his support comes from republicans, though his positions on gay rights and abortion rights might attract some democratic voters as he becomes better known.""his campaign has hurt both of them, although potts clearly has centered his criticisms on kilgore,"" sabato said. ""but kaine has to be worried about potts's popularity in northern virginia and some of his stances that might be popular there.""",

1022232503,Washington Post The,2012-06-27,Commentary,EDITORIAL-OPINION,Political campaigns,A.17,744,Feeling the Arizona heat,"as the supreme court rules this week on a variety of volatile issues, the question has come up: is barack obama really running against the high court?it might seem so on the surface, especially given the potential fallout, should the justices overturn portions or all of the affordable care act.instead, the justices have caused problems for mitt romney.monday's ruling on arizona's immigration law is a case in point. although the majority ruled against some parts of the law, including a provision that would have made failure to carry registration documents a state misdemeanor, the court left in place other provisions that may raise antipathy toward republicans to new levels.one among them allows state law enforcement officers to determine whether someone they stop, detain or arrest for some other reason is in the country legally. the obvious concern is that enforcement would lead to racial profiling. and of course it will because we can be pretty certain that caucasians pulled over for, say, speeding won't be required to produce proof of citizenship.unless, that is, state officials realize that treating everyone equally is the only way to avoid charges of racial profiling. arizona gov. jan brewer (r) has promised that mechanisms are in place to ensure that hispanics are not singled out.what those mechanisms might be isn't clear, but one can imagine at least one possible scenario - a reiteration of the sort of willy-nilly, random granny-search ops we've witnessed since 9/11.taking a stroll through probability, let's say that officer smith pulls over paco ramirez and asks for proof of citizenship, and it turns out that paco is descended from three generations ofu.s.-born, tax-paying ramirezes. paco is probably going to be annoyed. he may be sufficiently annoyed to file a profiling (or harassment) complaint with the courts. after all, why, except that he looked hispanic, would the officer have asked for his papers?moreover, how likely is it that hispanic-looking folks will be pulled over for ""suspicious behavior"" for the sole purpose of checking those papers?the only way to avoid such charges, of course, is to also pull over karen miller and insist that she produce proof of citizenship. this is what random airport checks are all about. officers can't pull out muhammad bin laden even if he's sweating profusely and chanting ""allahu akbar"" unless they also pull over betty white.what we have here is a sticky wicket.and no one is in greater need of goo gone than mitt romney, who has said that arizona's law is a model for the rest of the nation. not only has that law been deemed at least partly unconstitutional, but romney is now positioned to be associated with profiling. not the best way to court the hispanic vote. worse, if arizona and other similarly minded states begin to apply the equal-treatment template across races and ethnicities, he'll have everybody mad at him.not that the arizona law is his fault, obviously. but angry people will pick the easiest target, and the obama campaign will make sure those dots are connected. one thing is for certain: romney can't change his mind. he's stuck with a position that, though appealing to arizonans and others who are justifiably angry with our inert (inept) federal government, is profoundly offensive to our american sense of fairness. we simply don't single out groups of people in this country for special scrutiny. what is expedient or even logical isn't always ethical, and better that we err on the side of the latter standard.one may argue that any smallish inconvenience is an acceptable price to pay in exchange for law and order. in fact, many americans don't mind airport searches or even x-ray examinations of their nethers. but the fact is, these security measures are unprecedented intrusions into our personal spaces - inarguably violations of our civil rights.thus, today's bargain is an exchange of freedom for greater security, and the question is whether it's worth it. if you're not here illegally, you might feel the trade-off is acceptable. but if you are citizen paco ramirez or one of the tens of millions of americans of hispanic descent, you might think something else. you might think you live in a police state, that your civil rights are in jeopardy, and that your family is under siege.and you might not be inclined to vote republican.",Republican Party

""i'm ready to excuse every democratic candidate for the things they said about me. i'm ready to turn that page.""yanukovich soon chimed in with similar appeals to voters. ""they thought they could make promises from election to election and not fulfill the promises, that people will forget,"" he said of tymoshenko and her allies.the improbable reversal of yanukovich's fortune points up the changes that have rattled ukraine in past years.the last time ukrainians voted for a president, in 2004, yanukovich won but his victory was tarnished by allegations of vote rigging. enraged crowds stormed into the streets to demand his ouster, and the orange revolution was born.the ensuing seasons have been tumultuous and often painful for ukraine. the politicians who had marched boldly through the frigid streets calling for a reinvented ukraine were now in office -- and promptly lost themselves in byzantine power plays, internecine wars and flashy shows of dubiously acquired wealth.meanwhile, the economic crisis under president viktor yushchenko has hammered the country, radically devaluing the currency and spreading unemployment and uncertainty throughout the provinces.""people are feeling that they've been lied to,"" said larisa kuchuba, a 60-year-old engineer who braved snow and thick blankets of black ice sunday to vote in south kiev.kuchuba cast her vote for one of the lesser-known opposition candidates. she didn't believe he stood the slightest chance of winning; her vote was cast in protest, she said.""the politicians did everything to keep one another from succeeding. they didn't do anything for the success of the country,"" she said. ""all they did was fight.""analysts warned that the presidency would be a bitterly fought-for prize, with the candidates accusing one another of fraud and going to court. the battle could drag on for months beyond the runoff.with the exit of yushchenko, whose approval ratings wallowed in the single digits in recent months, ukraine loses a president who strove to shake off the grip of moscow and reorient ukraine as a westernized land with strong allies in brussels and washington.but in a country where many people grow up speaking russian and feel nostalgically, culturally and religiously intertwined with russia, yushchenko's approach chafed nerves -- and eventually backfired as his opponents blamed him for the dangerous deterioration of relations with moscow.the kremlin now appears poised to restore some of its lost influence in ukraine because both leading candidates have friendly relations with russian leaders.in the years since the orange revolution, the very word ""orange"" lost its linguistic role as proud shorthand for the leaders who presented themselves as pro-western reformers and became an adjective generally uttered with a grimace or a roll of the eyes.its affections historically split between russia and europe, ukraine became a coveted battleground for influence between russia and the u.s., which heartily backed its drift away from moscow.but even that status was lost: ukraine found its foreign policy importance downgraded as president obama sought to ease tensions with the kremlin.",

that ole' ""summer slide,"" ""skill-slippage ""or so-called ""brain drain."" no matter how what you call it, the fact is it's a major concern for many parents and educators alike.a study published in the american educational research journal in 2020 found that students lost, on average, about 20% of their school-year gains in reading and 27% of their school-year gains in math during summertime. a recent harris poll commissioned by educational software company justsystems underscored those results as well, showing some 91% of elementary school parents in the u.s. want their kids to continue learning over the summer months.the last thing many of us parents want to do over our summer break too is nag, cajole or bribe our kids into doing homework when we all just want to relax and have fun. the good news is there are several new tech tools that can help everyone out – without getting kids stuck on screens.do tablets help kids learn?for millions of kids, a tablet is one of the first devices they use to explore the digital world, but it can be a real double-edged sword too. i've seen kids as young as 2 so sucked in and tuned out watching baby shark on an ipad – they don't realize there's a pair of insanely cute puppies and an entire cream cake sitting right next to them. try to pry it out of their sweaty little palms, and they throw a full-blown hissy fit. it's sad.here's the thing: rather than just hand them your shared adult ipad and hope for the best, invest $200 or less on a tablet built from the wires up just for kids.what should i look for in a kid's tablet?for elementary ages and preteens, you want to consider the overall value of the gadget for the price.battery life: some models over up to 10 hours of battery life. don't consider tdels with fewer than eight hours of battery life.extras: consider what else you get for the price, whether a sturdy case, two-year guarantee and free suite of parental controls or free subscriptions that can provide age-appropriate, kid-focused content without ads, access to social media or adult sites.can i share my ipad with my child instead?ipads are expensive. kids are clumsy. also, when you share an adult tablet with your child, it's a huge hassle to try to set up parental controls that you can easily toggle on and off as you hand it back and forth. for many popular tablet models, you need to pay for a third-party app to go between what grown-ups can access versus what kids can see, do and watch.i talk a lot about training wheel tech. just like you teach your child to ride a bike or swim or eventually drive a car – you don't just toss them into the deep end or hand them the keys and expect it to all go perfectly.it's the same with tech. you have to start with the basics, teach and guide them, then take off the floaties, training wheels and ""student driver"" placard as they mature, grow and get more capable of self-regulation.what are the disadvantages of using technology for kids' education?as a mom, it drives me nuts to walk inside on a gorgeous day and see kids stuck on the couch with their noses buried in a screen. with all things tech and growing up these days, balance is key. kids need to spend time outside, playing, socializing, exploring the real world and relaxing. not worrying about schoolwork.it's also really important for parents to set and enforce boundaries around tech for kids, even when it's not fun or easy, explained catherine teitelbaum, a former teacher, and principal at amazon family trust.""while kids don't like rules around tech, they do value them. it makes them feel safe and connected like your parents are looking out for you and thinking through and making informed decisions,"" she added.tech tools for learning should be so much fun that kids don't even realize you snuck in ""school."" before you know it, we could all be talking about the good ole' summer ""brain gain"" too.the views and opinions expressed in this column are the author's and do not necessarily reflect those of usa today.as a mom, it drives me nuts to walk inside on a gorgeous day and see kids stuck on the couch with their noses buried in a screen. with all things tech and growing up these days, balance is key. kids need to spend time outside, playing, socializing, exploring the real world and relaxing. not worrying about schoolwork. it's also really important for parents to set and enforce boundaries around tech for kids, even when it's not fun or easy, explained catherine teitelbaum, a former teacher, and principal at amazon family trust.",

(actually, the relationship is really, really mature, since bruno is 80.) when bruno resigned from the senate last year, he quickly got a great job as c.e.o. of cma.a guy who was being investigated by federal prosecutors for his consulting activities would not normally be regarded as a perfect hire for an information technology consulting business, particularly when he seems to know as much about information technology as he does about quantum physics. still, it was nice to finally see a woman on the powerful, job-dispensing side of these stories.one of the positive aspects of recent political gossip is that the women seem to be getting tougher. jenny sanford, who won public acclaim for refusing to stand by her husband, south carolina gov. mark sanford, during the appalachian trail debacle, was just named one of the ""10 most fascinating people in 2009"" on a barbara walters special. (her fellow honorees included kate gosselin, the betrayed-wife-and-mother-of-sextuplets, lady gaga and adam lambert. the clear message here is that the best routes to being fascinating are an adulterous husband or lots of eye makeup.)on the show, she repeated her contention that even if her husband had asked her to stand next to him during his confessional press conference, she wouldn't have complied. we can probably look back on 2009 as the year that finished off the loyal-wife-photo-op, even though in the sanfords' case, having jenny in the room would have helped. she might not have looked all that supportive, but when the governor promised to give the assembled press corps ""way more detail than you'll ever want,"" she probably would have slapped her hand over his mouth.a subcommittee in the state legislature voted on wednesday not to impeach sanford and merely voted unanimously to censure him for bringing ""ridicule, dishonor, disgrace and shame"" to his state. a great victory! sanford will be able to finish his term and perhaps go on to a rewarding career as an adventure vacation guide, or professional wrestling referee.that leaves senator john ensign of nevada as the current holder of the most likely to be turned out of office title. the ethics committee is investigating efforts ensign made to help his ex-aide, doug hampton, get a lobbying job after hampton found out that his boss was sleeping with mrs. hampton.hampton, you may remember, first told his story with the remark: ""all of those tentacles were birthed because john needed things to go down like this."" obviously not the easiest guy to place.this could be a new rule of political sex: never have an affair with the wife of an employee. but if you do, make sure you are not the only person in the world who would hire the cuckolded husband.of course, that comes after the prime directive: never have an affair with anyone who would enjoy seeing themselves on the cover of ""in touch"" magazine.that was the point where tiger should have been paying attention.gail collins   nicholas d. kristof is off today.",

""now, i don't even go out the front door. it's very different."" tarlow has decided to move off the block and rent out the two buildings that she owns.""it used to be beautiful,"" ahmad ahmadi, the owner of ariana rugs, said with a sigh. ""it was all antique mom-and-pop stores, high-end interiors from floor coverings to furniture to fabrics. it was really a destination for a lot of international decorators.""ahmadi said he was leaving the area after a decade on the street because his landlord had increased his rent from $4 a square foot per month to $25. ""they are forcing me out,"" ahmadi said. ""the amount of money they are asking -- how can i afford it?""melrose place came of age in the 1960s and '70s, said historian marc wanamaker, when the demand for retail space for high-end antique stores along la cienega overflowed to the street. because it was a little more isolated, melrose place became a cheaper place to buy into, wanamaker said, and the area quickly became a district all its own.antique stores along the street featured furniture and other home furnishings from the 18th and early 19th century, wanamaker said: ""the quality of their works of art was absolutely impeccable. . . . you could go in there and you could trust them. they were not going to rip you off. they would be catering to connoisseurs, not just someone decorating a house. from the '70s, to the '80s and '90s, melrose place would have that reputation.""many of the original antique dealers were gay men or couples who retired and then died, leaving no family members to carry on the business, wanamaker said. after the first fashion stores moved in, other ""owner-operators"" chose to take advantage of surging prices along the street, sell their buildings and move their home-furnishings businesses elsewhere.""it just ended,"" wanamaker said. ""an era ended. that's how you can say that.""michael shabani, whose family has for more than four decades owned the building marc jacobs moved into, said that much of the shift has been deliberate on the part of landlords, who ""identify areas we feel fashion tenants will like. . . . this was just bound to happen.""but some landlords and tenants say that the recent shift has been driven by the buying power of one organization: the nasa group, a collection of silent partners who claim they control 60% of the property on the block, either as owners or long-term leasers. property records show that limited-liability corporations tracing back to nasa own seven buildings on the block.samantha feld, a broker who does leasing, sales and acquisitions for nasa and acts as its spokeswoman, said that the fascination with melrose place began three years ago, when the company purchased a building at 8428 melrose place. ""we felt [it] was really charming,"" she said. ""we had never been to the street before. but it has a unique feeling to it. all of the buildings have so much character.""part of that building is now leased out to bird, a fashion firm that moved from robertson boulevard two years ago for many of the same reasons.caption: photo: empty space: pedestrians walk past a store for lease on melrose place. once a destination for high-end antiques and home-furnishing stores, the street has become a fashion lover's mecca.; photographer:genaro molina los angeles times; photo: customer: tina ghods, who works nearby, waits for her take-out order in front of a restaurant on melrose place.

433388794,New York Times,2006-08-06,Commentary,3,Investment banking,3.3,1266,"My Country, Right and Wrong (but Why So Wrong?)","like many people, i am attracted to puzzles. i don't do crossword puzzles, and i no longer read many mysteries, but i am impressed at the number of conundrums there are in this world.one of the ones that continues to baffle me is the criticism of oil companies in congress and in the mainstream media, because oil companies have been very profitable. no one has been able to prove price-fixing. the federal trade commission specifically studied the subject, and found neither price-fixing nor gouging by any major oil company.i agree the profits are very large in absolute numbers, but in relative terms they are nothing like investment bank profits. why do we not raise an eyebrow when hedge funds make huge profits by moving around pieces of paper and roiling markets -- creating no social good i can see -- but raise a ruckus when oil companies make profits while keeping the whole nation going?i see the hand of an archaic envy here, and it's a dangerous hand.a second puzzle, and this is a killer: ''supply side'' economists say that by lowering taxes, we create more prosperity and more tax revenue because we stimulate economic activity. one way, supposedly, is that people work harder -- that is, more hours a week. with taxes cut, we keep more of what we earn, so we'll work more.(of course, you could also say that if we keep more of what we earn, we won't need to work as much, so we'll work less. but no one pays much attention to that, so we won't either for right now.)and, in fact, if you think about it, how else could income tax cuts stimulate economic activity except by encouraging americans to work more or else by having more americans in the labor force?yet, the number of hours americans work per week has barely budged in the five years since president bush's tax cuts, and is very much less than the number of hours worked per week on average in 1959, when tax rates were far, far higher than they are now.moreover, the percentage of male americans in the labor force has fallen by 10 full percentage points from 1959 to now. overall labor force participation has barely changed since 1989 -- almost entirely because of very large growth in the female labor force -- and has moved almost not at all since the bush tax cuts were passed.if the personal income tax cuts are not working to stimulate the economy through added labor, then just how are they working -- or are they working?a puzzle: we have all heard corporate executives say that american workers are paid too much; that our industries cannot compete with foreign makers because our labor costs are so high that if we used american union labor, we would see profits evaporate.and yet, hourly wages in this country, adjusted for inflation, are below what they were in 1972 (when my pal, richard nixon, was president) by a substantial amount. but to hear corporate leaders tell it, this is still far too high to allow competition with foreign entities.now, you would think that if this high-priced american labor were in fact pressing corporate backs to the wall, profits would be stagnant or falling. but in fact, in the last several years -- and especially the last few quarters -- corporate profits as a percentage of sales were the highest they have been since 1965 -- roughly 9.6 percent before tax and roughly 7.4 percent after tax.in total, profits are by far the highest they have ever been, running at a rate of very roughly $1.38 trillion in the first quarter of 2006. as a percentage of gross domestic product, profits are also the highest they have been since the statistics began being kept in 1959 -- roughly 12.7 percent.don't get me wrong. i like profits, a lot. they are what the capitalist society is all about. but why are we outsourcing, why are we moving our work overseas, if our corporations are so profitable? and if our corporate world is so profitable, how come so little of the growth goes to workers' wages? how come -- as an average number -- basically none of the growth goes to the ordinary worker's wages? i am not saying this to encourage strikes. i am genuinely puzzled about it.could it be that just the threat of moving jobs overseas (very few have in fact actually been moved as yet) keeps labor cowed? is the vast labor force of asia and the third world in fact something like ''the reserve army of the unemployed'' that karl marx described in his critique of capitalism?i hate and detest marx and everything he stands for, but he was a shrewd observer. in any event, what's going on? how can retail stores keep wages so low? all service jobs that have to be done in person are not going to be shipped to guangdong or mumbai. then why don't their wages rise?next mystery: in a nation with stupendous deficits even at the peak of the business cycle, with forecast deficits of nuclear-disaster status, how can it be important to repeal the estate tax? isn't there enough income and wealth inequality in america? don't we need the revenue? how on earth can any social good come from making taxes on the rich even lower than they are? how does this bind the nation together in time of war?don't get me wrong about this one, either. my father died in 1999. my sister paid a stunning tax on his estate and i would have preferred to keep the money. but my father was intensely grateful to this country for the opportunities it had afforded him. so are my sister and i. we don't see any unfairness in paying back to the government that pays the soldiers and marines and pilots and sailors who defend us and allowed our little family to move to the suburbs. (actually my sister lives in brooklyn, but that's another story.)why should the very rich not pay their fair share of the burdens of government? i could see a different argument if we were not hundreds of billions in the red, but in the real world, how can repeal or a drastic cut in the estate tax make social, moral or fiscal policy sense?here's my final puzzle: in a world that is clearly going down the tubes, where the forces of barbarism are on the march and the forces of civilization cannot stop them, why don't we all spend a large part of every day being grateful we are where we are?this country, with all of its problems, with all of its inequality and puzzles, is a verdant, lovely garden compared with the shrieking lunacy in so much of the world outside it. let's appreciate it enough to keep it.every question and criticism i make is within the context of a deep pride and thankfulness for being in america. i wake up in america the way i wake up in my own skin, to paraphrase my new hero, philip roth, and it's an old skin, but it's mine and i love it.drawing (drawing by philip anderson)",

(fidel last made an appearance in 2000.)there wasn't so much as a drop-by from sudanese president omar hassan al-bashir. that's probably because he faces international war crimes charges, accused of orchestrating a campaign of murder, torture and forced expulsions in darfur, and would probably be arrested on the spot.speaking of the united nations, equatorial guinea's foreign minister used the general assembly meeting to call on the u.n. educational, scientific and cultural organization (unesco) to stop stalling and start giving out the life sciences award set up in the name of that country's dictator, teodoro obiang nguema.loop fans may recall that the award, endowed for five years by a $3 million gift from obiang, was set up two years ago - over objections by washington and the european union - and then stalled over outrage from the human rights community.the issue popped up again in june as obiang, in power for 31 years, accused opponents who were trying to block the prize of being ""colonialist, discriminatory, racist and prejudiced.""but archbishop emeritus desmond tutu of south africa told unesco, ""a beacon for hope and development,"" not to allow ""itself to burnish the unsavory reputation of a dictator"" whose regime ""has been marked by corruption and abuse.""unesco's executive board agreed to study the matter further, deferring the question again. hard to imagine unesco would destroy once and for all its reputation for a lousy $3 million.so, what's with all that digging on west executive drive between the west wing and the eisenhower executive office building? the drilling and pounding, which started in may, are driving folks in nearby offices to distraction. a new bunker in the works?not so, says the general services administration. the official response: ""the construction [is] to replace aged and service-interruption-prone heating, cooling, electrical, fire alarm equipment and systems serving the west wing.""the gsa says it's ""constantly working to mitigate as much as possible any impact on the day to day work at the white house."" sounded like the end of the world a couple of days ago.when will this end - and, more important for some, when will the parking perks on the drive be restored? ah, well, ""looks like it will be more than a year,"" we were told.private sector, anyone?the agency for international development, supposedly running the third prong of the obama foreign policy of defense, diplomacy and development, didn't have an administrator for the first year of the administration - despite all the earnest talk about elevating the importance of development.after administrator rajiv shah was sworn in to run the place, his picture joined those of obama, vice president biden and secretary of state hillary rodham clinton on the wall in the agency lobby.but shah's photo recently disappeared. aid folks, prone to machiavellian thinking, wondered whether this was a sign, a la the soviets erasing photos of trotsky.""maybe they're trying to send a message that he's no higher than a deputy secretary so why should his picture hang there?"" one employee speculated.not really. seems the problem is that you can't drill into metal wall, so the pictures are hung with velcro, and sometimes they fall down. ""part of elevating development will involve upgrading to industrial-strength velcro,"" said spokeswoman lynne weil. a visit to home depot appears to be in order.as expected, morgan stanley executive tom nides, formerly at credit suisse first boston, fannie mae and the bill clinton-era u.s. trade rep's office, has been nominated as deputy secretary of state for management and resources. he would replace jack lew, whose nomination to run the office of management and budget has been held by sen. mary landrieu (d-la.) to protest the gulf oil-drilling moratorium.michael vickers, now assistant secretary of defense for special operations/low-intensity conflict and interdependent capabilities (solic&ic), has been picked to move up to undersecretary for intelligence.",United Nations--UN

uniformly manicured and catering to the high life and high tech-- because of the influence of one man. uc irvine, fashion island, the irvine spectrum, university research park, newport coast, orange county's thousands of acres of wilderness and parkland and its enviable public school systems all bear bren's imprint. so does the new majority, a growing coalition of wealthy, socially moderate republicans who helped vault gov. arnold schwarzenegger, an old skiing buddy of bren, into office. he's the richest man in orange county--worth an estimated $7.5 billion, according to the o.c. business journal--and has been snapping up property in century city, san diego and the silicon valley as well. he is publicity-shy and enigmatic but don't let his style fool you: bren's involvement can mean life or death for a voter initiative, political campaign or philanthropic cause. his priorities are education, conservation (penance for a guy who has paved over a good chunk of the county?) and continuing to lift the o.c. out of l.a.'s long, but ever- shortening, shadow.2. eli broadcivic leader // 73, brentwoodit's one thing to be rich. it's another to use your money--in broad's case, $5.6 billion, according to the l.a. business journal-- to insert yourself into virtually every major decision affecting the civic life of a city. broad's zeal for a renaissance in downtown l.a. saved disney hall when lagging donations threatened to turn it into an expensive underground garage. he has given us a serious high school for the arts while shaping the museum of contemporary art, the los angeles county museum of art and the grand avenue project. he's also expressed an interest in buying the times. broad has heaped a fortune on caltech, ucla, pitzer and usc, which this year received $25 million to create a stem-cell research institute named for him. his foundation trains public school superintendents, he recruited roy romer to head the los angeles unified school district and he now supports mayoral control of lausd--so strongly that he recently spanked mayor antonio villaraigosa for ceding too much power to the teachers unions. before all this, broad made his mark in other ways: his homebuilding company, kaufman & broad, sowed greater l.a. with middle-class ranch houses--what some would call the region's signature sprawl.3. barbara e. kerrpresident, california teachers assn. // 59, riversideit's not clear if kerr has ever gotten her first-grade class in riverside to listen. but she sure has the attention of the mayor and governor. no issue is more critical to the future of the region than education, and nobody wields more influence in this arena than does kerr, president of the 335,000-member union. with united teachers los angeles president a.j. duffy stepping back and letting her do most of the talking, kerr engineered the deal in june with villaraigosa that would, among other things, strip power from the lausd board and give individual teachers much more sway over classroom instruction. critics say the mayor caved in to the unions, but it's no surprise that kerr has villaraigosa's ear. under her direction, the cta helped defeat villaraigosa's opponent, incumbent james hahn, with a tv attack ad in 2005. the lausd deal must next pass muster in sacramento, where kerr knows how to mix it up. just look what she did to gov. schwarzenegger last year after he reneged on an education-funding agreement. kerr and her troops went to war, helping defeat a slate of special election ballot measures that schwarzenegger was pushing. who's the terminator now?4. antonio villaraigosalos angeles mayor // 53, windsor squaremuch of his power is derived simply from his position as head of the region's biggest city. but it's far more than that. with seemingly boundless energy, villaraigosa is bent on putting his stamp on all of the local hot-button issues of the day--crime, transportation and education--in a way that his predecessors never managed. he has forged close ties with the city council, winning easy passage of his first budget and an increase in trash collection fees to pay for more cops. although he is l.a.'s first latino mayor in more than 130 years--making him an important symbol locally and nationally--villaraigosa has worked hard to embrace different communities throughout the city. his detractors say he is perpetually in campaign mode and can be weak on policy details. and he has taken plenty of lumps on the lausd deal. but villaraigosa still has the benefit of the doubt from all the players who really count, be they in the union halls; the legislature, where he once called the shots as assembly speaker; or the governor's office.5. roger mahonyarchbishop, archdiocese of l.a. // 70, los angeleswith 5 million roman catholics in l.a., ventura and santa barbara counties, mahony boasts a huge flock, especially in the latino community. some say the church's sex abuse scandal has undermined his influence, but there's another way to look at it: mahony's ability to keep secret the files of priests suspected of misconduct underscores just how powerful he is. (the church was compelled in april to turn over internal documents to a los angeles county grand jury, but mahony is still resisting in civil cases.) all the while, he remains a force in the immigration debate. the we are america coalition used pleas from mahony to help turn out hundreds of thousands of protesters in may. mahony has also helped change the face of downtown with the $200-million cathedral of our lady of the angels--a concrete and alabaster edifice that wags have dubbed the ""taj mahony"" and ""rog mahal.""6. philip anschutzindustrialist // 66, denversouthern california has more than its share of absentee landlords. few, however, have had as much impact as anschutz, who forbes says is now worth $6.4 billion. the tycoon made his first fortune in oil and gas and built a 130-mile pipeline from kern county to wilmington. he owns staples center, the home depot center in carson, the kings hockey team, the galaxy soccer franchise and (with ed roski) nearly 30% of the lakers. staples has been an anchor in the revitalization of downtown los angeles, and anschutz's entertainment company aeg--operating through l.a.-based lieutenant tim leiweke--plans to spend more than $1 billion to construct an adjacent hotel and commercial development that promises to inject even more life into the area. anschutz is also a mover in hollywood, with a controlling interest in movie theater chain regal entertainment and an eye for producing films geared toward children and families. he's had his misses--""around the world in 80 days"" was a box-office dud--but ""the chronicles of narnia"" served as a $1- billion lesson to the rest of the industry on the profitability of family entertainment.7. henry samuelicofounder, broadcom corp. // 51, corona del marsamueli isn't your typical orange county mogul. sure, he owns the anaheim ducks hockey franchise and the company that manages the arrowhead pond. but before his net worth swelled to $2.4 billion (according to forbes), this son of holocaust survivors ran a liquor store. samueli became a professor of electrical engineering at ucla, and today is the named inventor on 36 u.s. patents; besides serving as chairman of chip maker broadcom, he remains its chief technical officer. the youngest member of the top 10 list, samueli is a rising star in regional affairs, where he has given more than $160 million mostly to educational and healthcare institutions. two engineering schools are named after him (at ucla and uc irvine), and a center for alternative medicine at uci is named for his wife, susan. samueli may become even more of a household name if he realizes his next dream: bringing an nba franchise to anaheim.8. jerry bruckheimertv and film producer // 61, l.a. and bloomfield, ky.nobody in hollywood has more clout these days than this master of screens big and small. his new release, ""pirates of the caribbean: dead man's chest,"" has shattered box-office records. each one of bruckheimer's movies is a mega-operation, supporting hundreds of local jobs (even when filming occurs elsewhere), and a substantial part of the next chapter in the ""pirates"" trilogy is slated to be shot in an old aircraft hangar in palmdale, a big lift for regional film production. but in some respects, it's in tv where bruckheimer is making the deepest impression. he is the producer of eight prime- time series now on the air--two shy of the record he set last season. these include his ""csi"" franchise, ""without a trace,"" ""cold case"" and his hit reality series ""the amazing race."" as much as anything, it was bruckheimer's move into prime-time television in 2000 that helped lift the stigma of working in the genre and signaled the start of l.a.'s shift from tinseltown to tv town. with that has come a boom in tv shoots--and many thousands of jobs for actors, writers, craftspeople and more.9. david gelbaumconservationist // 57, newport beachyou may never have heard of him and, at just 5-foot-5 with a slight build and soft-spoken demeanor, gelbaum may not seem particularly powerful. but by donating more to conservation causes than anyone in the state--anonymously--this hedge-fund multimillionaire has taken a leading role in safeguarding something near and dear to the hearts of many here: the outdoors. under the guidance of politically savvy environmentalist david myers, gelbaum's gifts have protected enough mountain and desert land to create another yosemite national park, and his donations to wilderness education programs have sent nearly half a million inner- city schoolchildren to the mountains, desert or beach, many for the first time. crucial tracts of the mojave national preserve have been protected, thanks to the wildlands conservancy, which gelbaum cofounded. these days, the conservancy finds itself in the thick of the debate over the development of tejon ranch in the teha-chapi mountains. the gelbaum-backed group, along with the sierra club and others, wants to reduce the amount of the ranch that will be paved and preserve 245,000 acres as wilderness-- a tussle that will help define the limits of growth in southern california.10. haim sabanmedia mogul // 61, beverly hillswe'll be honest: saban wouldn't have cracked the top 10 a few months ago. but his recent involvement in a deal to buy l.a.-based univision communications, by far the nation's largest spanish- language broadcaster, catapulted him to the fore. though saban doesn't have nearly as much money in the $13.7-billion purchase as do the private-equity firms with which he's partnered, it will be largely up to him to figure out where the company goes from here--a vision that will ultimately be reflected in millions of tv sets throughout southern california. that's because saban (who speaks five languages, including spanish) is the one with an extensive background in entertainment and media, having built his wealth (estimated at $3.1 billion by the los angeles business journal) on mighty morphin power rangers cartoons and the sale of fox family worldwide. saban's civic involvement has run more to national and international issues than local ones. however, he gave $40 million to childrens hospital los angeles, where wife cheryl serves on the board, and he has been a major supporter of the motion picture & television fund, which helps provide for those in the business who are in need.the next 90n. christian anderson iiipublisher and ceo, orange county register; 56, coto de cazait's tough to admit it, but anderson, a virtual lifer at orange county's leading newspaper, first as editor and then as publisher, waged a block-by-block newspaper war with the l.a. times on its home front until tribune co. bought the times and all but waved the white flag. it's impossible to ""out-local the locals,"" anderson said then. in proving his point, he has solidified o.c.'s separate identity in southern california.lee bacal.a. county sheriff; 64, san marinohis 8,000 deputies protect 2.7 million people and guard america's biggest jail system. turnover is high, homicides are up and 150,000 inmates have been released early over the last four years amid crowded conditions that a federal judge called ""not consistent with basic human values."" yet baca--so quirky that he is known within law enforcement circles as ""sheriff moonbeam""--just won a third term with ease.dean baqueteditor, l.a. times; 49, santa monicayeah, we know what some will say: how self-serving to put your boss on the list. but baquet, who won a pulitzer prize in chicago and served as the new york times' national editor before coming to l.a. in 2000, sets the agenda for the most powerful media voice in the region. with resources shrinking, how well baquet weathers budget pressures from long-distance owner tribune co. will go a long way toward determining how robust that voice remains.steve barrfounder, small schools alliance;47, silver lakethrough his green dot charter high schools, he's been a serious pain for the l.a. school district, luring away top teachers, organizing a parents union, launching five charter schools near jefferson high after the district rebuffed his takeover offer, testifying in sacramento and, along with california charter schools assn. head caprice young, generally ratcheting up the debate over the future of public education.stephen l. bingreal estate heir, 41; los angelesbing is perhaps best known for getting socked by actress-model elizabeth hurley with a successful paternity suit. but he is the playboy with a bit of policy wonk in him. last year he spent $4 million to deep-six proposition 77, the redistricting initiative. now the big democratic donor is bankrolling a measure to help fund alternative energy. bing also invests heavily in film projects and gives lots of dough anonymously to local causes, including education and the environment. recently spotted dining at jar with villaraigosa.bishop charles e. blakepastor, west angeles church of god in christ; 66, beverly hillswith the rev. cecil l. ""chip"" murray retired from first ame church in south l.a., blake has become the man to see when courting favor in the city's african american community. with 24,000 members, his congregation is among the largest in southern california. villaraigosa--who is close with blake's son-in-law, fallen labor leader martin ludlow--sat up front at a recent service, and the democratic gubernatorial candidates came by to pump blake's hand.william j. brattonl.a. police chief; 58, los felizhe's more than a law-and-order man; he's a celebrity, and with that comes the power of celebrity. as recent events show, bratton is tough enough to take on the city council--and savvy enough to know when to kiss and make up. politicians seek his endorsement, and other chiefs across the country look to his example. most importantly, he's been quite effective, restoring a measure of order and dignity to the long-suffering (and, some would add, insufferable) lapd.harry ""skip"" brittenhamentertainment attorney;64, santa monicaoperating largely under the radar, the highly trusted and intensely competitive brittenham represents more top studio executives than any other hollywood lawyer, while also counting among his clients some of the town's biggest a-list stars--tom hanks included--and major corporations. indeed, brittenham has factored into virtually every huge deal in hollywood over the last two decades, including the sales of dreamworks skg to viacom and pixar animation studios to disney.james brultegovernment affairs consultant;50, fontanaas the former gop leader of both state houses before he was termed- out of the legislature, brulte has deep connections that run clear to the white house. he hangs his hat these days at california strategies, a top political consulting firm. brulte was the founding member of the budding inland empire chapter of the new majority, and has filed to run for the state board of equalization in four years. meanwhile, gov. schwarzenegger has enlisted him to frame debates with phil angelides, and on the other side of the aisle, he delivered crucial support for villaraigosa's election.ron burkleinvestor; managing partner,yucaipa cos.; 53, beverly hillsthe billionaire, who just missed our top 10 list, maintains close relationships with politicians of all stripes (from villaraigosa to former gov. pete wilson) and is said to give generously (and anonymously) to local causes. a big friend of labor, the onetime supermarket magnate dispenses advice to the united food and commercial workers. he has been involved with trying to bring an nfl team to l.a., and he's signaled interest in buying the times.jerry bussowner, l.a. lakers and l.a. sparks,73, playa vistasome fans will never forgive him for letting relations between his two top players fester and ultimately casting his lot with kobe over shaq (who just picked up another championship ring in miami). but the fact remains: in spite of the clippers' rise, the lakers remain the no. 1 show in a sports-obsessed town. its games are the place to be seen by hollywood royalty and myriad other power brokers, and buss is the man who has engineered the spectacle for more than 25 years, bringing eight championships to town.rick carusodeveloper; 47, brentwooda kitsch-meister? perhaps. but the developer of the grove, the outdoor mall adjacent to the l.a. farmers market; the americana at brand near the glendale galleria; and other retail-entertainment projects has altered the shopping landscape and transformed neighborhoods. the former head of the l.a. police commission can play tough too: when opponents tried to stop him in glendale, he beat back a ballot initiative and then sued his rivals.dov charneyfounder and ceo, american apparel;37, los angeleshe's gotten into some hot water for creating a sexually charged atmosphere at his company, but this outspoken advocate for immigrant rights has made his mark in a more profound way as well: he has shown that you can compensate your workers decently and still compete in the local garment business. charney's downtown l.a. factory is the largest single apparel plant in the nation, employing 3,800 workers, the vast majority of whom are latino. he pays an average of $12.50 an hour, and many of his workers purchase cheap, company-subsidized health insurance and enjoy other perks.siu-man chiul.a. county health specialist;50, temple citychiu has dispensed letter grades at hundreds of chinese restaurants in the san gabriel valley. there's no way to be sure if she and her colleagues reduced hospitalizations for food-borne illness--13% countywide, according to one study--but we feel better about our kung pao knowing that chiu has been on the case.sean collinssurf forecaster; 54, seal beachthose empty cubicles all around you mean one thing: surf's up. an early developer of the online surf check, collins' website (www.surfline.com) pulls in 1.5 million visitors a month. some boarders grouse that collins has made the beach intolerably crowded, but his unmatched ability to accurately predict the size and destination of rideable waves ensures that no ""sick"" day ever goes to waste. and so, thanks to him, at least the workplace is a lot more mellow.warren m. christophersenior partner, o'melveny& myers; former u.s. secretaryof state; 81, beverly hillsone of a handful of octogenarians on the list, christopher has slowed some of late. but behind the scenes, he continues to advise local leaders on a variety of matters, including effective governance. the man who investigated the causes of the watts riots in the '60s and headed the commission that reformed the lapd after the rodney king beating is now looking into whether to scrap or extend l.a.'s term limits for public office.robert addison daybusinessman; philanthropist;62, bel-airthe grandson of superior oil co. founder william m. keck and founder in his own right of trust co. of the west, day oversees the w.m. keck foundation, a $1.3-billion nonprofit that has underwritten, among other things, the keck school of medicine at usc, the keck graduate institute at claremont colleges and health and medical facilities in east l.a. the billionaire--who also sits on the boards of the broad foundation and claremont mckenna college- -is a major, albeit low-key, philanthropic influence.james dotipresident, chapman university;59, villa parkdoti has transformed a quiet private college in orange county into an influential university with seven- and eight-figure gifts pouring in. political insider paul folino sits on the board of trustees. financier lawrence dodge and his wife, kristina, kicked in $20 million for the new film school. doti has doubled physical growth on campus since 1991, when he took over, and tripled academic space. on top of all that, the phd economist helps produce a financial forecast that's well respected by the business community.peter m. douglasexecutive director, california coastal commission; 64, larkspurdouglas doesn't get a vote on the commission, but he is no mere bureaucrat. as the panel's senior staffer for more than 20 years, he has as much--if not more--influence over coastal communities and beachfront access as any of its 12 members. after the commission beat back hollywood mogul david geffen's effort to keep the public off the beach near his malibu home, douglas didn't mince words: ""with all of the lobbying power and legal power he could afford to buy, in the end, the public's rights prevailed.""dr. michael v. drakechancellor, uc irvine; 55, irvinecall him dr. fix-it. arriving just as uci was being nailed for hospital and medical school-related scandals--yet again--drake launched investigations into problems with the transplant program, beefed up oversight of the medical school and medical center, and demoted the hospital's chief executive. the result: uci's lackluster relationship with the rest of orange county is already improving, with fundraising now at record levels.maria elena durazoexecutive secretary-treasurer, l.a. county federation of labor // 53, el serenobecause she was elected in march, it's too soon to know just how effective durazo will be in running the region's largest labor group, an organization that counts under its umbrella 350-plus unions representing more than 800,000 workers. doubters say durazo-- the widow of the federation's late leader, miguel contreras--will never match her husband's immense clout. but she has a lot going for her, including a longtime friendship with mayor villaraigosa. the big question is whether the woman who showed herself to be a firebrand while leading the hotel workers union (her husband called her ""agitational"") can in her new role build bridges to business, government and other unions.joe edmistonexecutive director, santa monica mountains conservancy;57, pacific palisadeshis critics mutter that he has built an empire that is off- limits to everything except his ego and his lust for more land. but the conservancy now controls more than 62,000 acres of once-private turf between east ventura county and the whittier narrows largely because of edmiston's political and financial savvy. among his recent trophies: the 2,900-acre ahmanson ranch.douglas r. failingdirector, caltrans district 7 // 48, arcadiafailing oversees a stretch of 1,188 miles of freeway in l.a. and ventura counties on which drivers log the daily equivalent of 4,000 trips around the globe. of course, sometimes it feels like 8,000. but failing is trying hard to move in the right direction. under his leadership, caltrans is set to build the first high-occupancy- vehicle lane on i-5 in l.a. county, has added 21 miles of carpool lanes on the 405, has installed electronic signs with estimated travel times, has launched the 101-405 interchange improvement project and has taken numerous other steps to try to ease gridlock.paul folinoceo, emulex corp.; 61, coto de cazaa onetime backer of an after-school programs initiative started by then-actor schwarzenegger, folino now heads the founding chapter of the new majority, a group of wealthy republicans organized in early 2000. a key fundraiser for the governor, he has elevated the organization from an ""insurgency of misled millionaires,"" as one gop hard-liner once grumbled, to a broadly inclusive, center-right juggernaut with 150 members in o.c., 85 in l.a. county and new chapters in the inland empire and san diego county.david geffenlongtime record producer; cofounder, dreamworks skg; 63, malibugeffen is another enormous name who barely fell out of our top 10 list. the ucla school of medicine--where geffen pledged $200 million, the most ever to a u.s. medical school--bears his name. so does the geffen playhouse, geffen contemporary and other local institutions. he also has given significant sums to aids organizations, including at a time when the topic made other philanthropists a little queasy. downtown power brokers grouse that he doesn't do quite enough civically these days. but that could all change if he steps in to buy the l.a. times.frank gehryarchitect; 77, santa monicathe west coast's reigning star architect languished in l.a. for years. but he started to roll in the early 1990s, and since its completion in 2003, disney hall has made gehry a symbol of l.a.'s creative life. he's now working on the grand avenue project, intended to give downtown l.a. a residential-commercial heart. in five years, it'll be easy to look back and see how many local buildings, from low-slung westside homes to downtown skyscrapers, are his.jim gilchristanti-illegal immigration activist;57, aliso viejoa retired accountant, this cofounder of the minuteman project and his volunteers began patrolling the arizona-mexico border last year with private planes and night-vision goggles. the unsuccessful congressional candidate has put fresh heat on a perennial hot button, fomenting debate--and division--from national political circles to hometown parades in places such as laguna beach and pacific palisades.kevin goetzmanaging director; executive vice president, otx; 44, studio citygot a blockbuster in the pipeline? chances are that goetz will have something to say about how it gets released. the hottest market research company in hollywood is otx, where goetz and his team provide studios with tracking information about audience interest in upcoming films. a former child actor who has appeared in many commercials--he was the domino's pizza boy for a couple of years-- goetz personally tests about five movies a week and has a hand in about half the flicks that leave hollywood.stanley p. goldceo, shamrock capital advisors; chairman, usc board of trustees;64, beverly hillsgold may be best known for joining with his associate, roy disney, to lead a shareholder revolt against walt disney co. and then-ceo michael eisner in 2004. but gold's local influence has long reached beyond hollywood. shamrock, the disney family's investment company, manages a $150-million fund that puts money into low- to moderate-income neighborhoods around l.a. it also owns industrial and commercial properties in koreatown, carson and other parts of the southland. gold himself has made millions in gifts to usc, where he has chaired the board since 2002.nick haquerestaurateur; 40, hollywooda certain clout comes with being the owner of the hottest restaurant in l.a., and as the owner of koi, haque hasn't been shy about exploiting it. celebrities are thick on the ground at his establishments, which include bridge, and haque's anti-paparazzi system is said to be one of the most elaborate and hardest to crack in the city. nonetheless, rumor has it that at least one celebrity magazine has spent thousands of dollars on meals at koi just so gossip columnists could sit in the dining room and report on star sightings.antonia hernandezpresident and ceo, california community foundation; 58, pasadenathe foundation--which boasts assets of $800 million and shepherds tens of millions of dollars in donations to local nonprofits each year--is one of the most vital philanthropic organizations in l.a. county. since taking charge of the group in 2004, hernandez has pushed it in new directions, focusing on quality-of-life issues for the elderly and at-risk youth while steering away from job training and other areas where it has been harder to show gains. before coming to the foundation, hernandez for 18 years headed the mexican american legal defense and educational fund.robert hertzbergattorney; 52, sherman oaksthe former california assembly speaker is one of the few local politicians with credibility and solid connections on both the left and the right, as evidenced by hertzberg's working relationships with villaraigosa and schwarzenegger. although hertzberg lost his bid for mayor of los angeles, he remains a discreet advisor on civic issues such as economic development, transportation and term limits, and he's an important champion for the san fernando valley.alan hornpresident, warner bros.; environmentalist; 63, bel-airwarner bros. has had a disappointing summer at the box office with ""poseidon"" and ""lady in the water,"" but horn gets high marks across hollywood for being a class act and a solid guy. he makes our list, though, for another reason: in between green-lighting movies, horn has shown himself to be green in another way, enlisting a bevy of entertainment executives to back the national resources defense council. now it's arguably the state's leading environmental organization and, with rob reiner (a former partner of horn at castle rock entertainment) and laurie david in its corner, one of the hottest causes on the west coast.deirdre 'deedie' hudnutadmissions director, the center forearly education // 58, beverly hillsit could just be a myth that los angeles' most sought-after elementary school(and a favorite among the elite of the entertainment industry) is step one on the southern california fast track to the ivy league. still, up to 1,000 applicants a year vie for about 60 slots there. hudnut shares the task of picking, but she's the one who does the bulk of the interviewing. incidentally, her husband is headmaster at harvard-westlake, the private high school that's step two, or so they say.john husingprincipal, economics & politics inc.; 65, redlandshusing provides economic analysis and counsel to every major city in the inland empire, as well as to both riverside and san bernardino counties and two community colleges. he has also been key (along with southern california leadership council co-chair bob wolf) in positioning the area as a logistics and transportation hub. in his private life, husing has trekked in the himalayas, but the biggest mountain he has climbed is convincing people that the inland empire--long regarded as a backwater--is now a potent economic force.robert igerceo, walt disney co.; 55, brentwoodlong gone are the days when one entertainment chief--namely, mca's lew wasserman--was so powerful that his presence transcended all of hollywood. today, top executives pretty much keep their heads down. but walt disney co. is simply too big a fish--or should that be mouse?--to ignore with 30,000 employees in l.a. and orange counties. iger, of course, is at the helm of it all, having been named ceo following the tumultuous reign of michael eisner. iger has quickly stepped out of eisner's shadow, acquiring pixar animation studios, continuing to shake up the disney board and taking steps to move the company forward through the application of new technologies.frank jaochairman and ceo, bridgecreek group // 57, huntington beachjao got his start in the 1970s with a strip of vacant industrial buildings that he turned into a shopping center serving his fellow vietnamese exiles. since then, the man known as the ""godfather of little saigon"" has owned or developed roughly three-quarters of orange county's best-known ethnic commercial enclave and remains the community's biggest landlord. some 1,500 business tenants lease space in the half a dozen developments he owns there, and his holdings keep expanding. his latest ventures include the district's first major residential project. also, coastline community college has opened a little saigon-area campus, thanks in part to his largesse.earvin ""magic"" johnsonurban developer; 46, beverly hillspeople believe in magic to the point that his mere involvement gives cautious corporate investors the confidence to venture into inner-city neighborhoods. his magic johnson theatres (a partnership with loews cineplex entertainment) are lighting up the crenshaw district more than a decade after the 1992 riots. his real estate fund (another partnership, with canyon capital realty advisors) has underwritten redevelopment in hollywood and downtown l.a. his deal with starbucks--he's its sole outside partner--has brought jobs (and $3 lattes) to more than three dozen low-income neighborhoods in southern california. his political endorsement is among l.a.'s most influential, and talk persists of his mayoral potential.lucile m. jonesseismologist, u.s. geological survey; 51, la canada-flintridgetechnically, jones is a specialist in earthquake probabilities, but for 20 years she's been the ""earthquake mom,"" calming the public after a temblor with her reassurance and expertise. she's also an outspoken member of the state's seismic safety commission. when schwarzenegger's administration tried to fire jones earlier this year (on the centennial of the san francisco quake, no less) the reverberations were so strong that the governor overruled the removal the same day.steve ""jonesy"" jonesindie rock deejay; former sex pistol; 50, benedict canyonhis playlist on kdld/kdle-fm (103.1) is pretty much whatever the bloke feels like 'earing, which has made ""jonesy's jukebox"" not just one of l.a.'s hottest radio shows but the source of a cottage industry in downloads and cd sales. virgin megastores now feature ""jonesy's picks"" sections. at least three fledgling bands have gotten major label deals because jonesy played them. and though the station doesn't match the ratings or signal strength of l.a.'s alt- rock big dog kroq-fm (106.7), it's credited with forcing rivals to get edgier or step aside.bruce karatzchairman, kb home;

hint: the hotel's developers are local gop heavyweights, hadi makarechian and his son, paul. the elder makarechian made a fortune in construction on the east coast, retired in 1990 to california, then made another fortune building coastal mcmansions. a board member of orange county's new majority, he has donated prodigiously to schwarzenegger and his various initiatives. meanwhile, paul, a fledgling commercial developer, has helped launch gennext, a new majority spinoff for younger gop members.alfred e. mannbiotech entrepreneur; 80, beverly hillshis biotech ventures--11 at last count--have involved pacemakers, insulin pumps and much more. the alfred e. mann institute is an incubator for biomedical research. (usc was granted the $100- million-plus gift after the billionaire got fed up with the red tape at ucla, his alma mater.) but perhaps just as important, the 167- acre mann biomedical park, which houses several of his start-ups, spawned a biotech cluster that has perked up valencia.richard meruelodeveloper; 41, whittiermeruelo is said to be the largest private landowner in downtown l.a., controlling more than 100 properties with millions of square feet. but what made political types really take notice was the $197,300 he spent last year--more than any individual--to help elect villaraigosa. now he's making headlines for his aggressive real estate tactics. among them: battling architecture school sci-arc out of a downtown property it wanted and getting barred for five years from developing a parcel near union station as punishment for demolishing structures on it without a permit.michael milkeninvestor, philanthropist; 60, encinoyes, there will probably always be that boilerplate: ""disgraced former junk bond king."" but milken has been tireless in his other life as a philanthropist. he and his family have donated more than $750 million--a fifth of it locally--over the last three decades. and he doesn't just give; he takes on causes, with education high on the list. additionally, his underwriting of research into life- threatening diseases (cancer runs in his family) has meant new treatments for leukemia and breast cancer at ucla. to top it off, his milken institute is a leader in analyzing the local economy.arturo ""arte"" morenoowner of the angels; 60, phoenixmoreno's first act upon taking over the angels in 2003 was to endear himself to fans: he cut ticket and beer prices. later, he forced anaheim to let him wedge some other nearby city into its home team's name. orange county-ites and dodgers devotees in l.a. protested, but moreno hung tough and his strategy is paying off. sports junkies from all over southern california feel increasingly free to root for the angels. moreno has also moved into spanish- language radio, the team has signed a lucrative broadcast rights contract, and forbes recently estimated that the team is now worth about twice what moreno paid.david murdockchairman, dole food co. andcastle & cooke; 83, hidden valleythe billionaire has been a big local political donor and a philanthropic pioneer. when he built a $4.5-million communal housing complex for the mentally ill near camarillo last year, the state's mental health director praised him for having ""set the model for the state."" now, the health-conscious murdock (he's a self-professed ""fish vegetarian"" and has pushed dole heavily into nutrition research) is off on a new venture: he has brought in a ucla scientist and insurer wellpoint inc. to help create the must-have reservation for well-off southland boomers. scheduled to open in november in westlake village, the california wellbeing institute four seasons portends an evolving niche: luxury healthcare.brian murphychairman, southern california music for live nation; 58, studio citythere are more important tastemakers in the concert world--paul tollett's annual coachella music and arts festival, for one. but murphy's company, spun off in december by clear channel entertainment, recently acquired its largest competitor, house of blues concerts, and thereby strengthened its dominance in deciding what we hear.sam nazarianceo, sbe entertainment group; 31, beverly hillswith his father's real estate business as a leg up and club impresario brent bolthouse as a partner, nazarian has taken control of most of the velvet ropes in l.a. the newly remodeled privilege; the soon-to-reopen area; the celebrity petting zoo of the moment, hyde; the swank supper club lobby--they all are nazarian's. at the reopening of privilege in july, the crowd spilled onto sunset boulevard like fans at a hollywood premiere. next up: a chain of japanese restaurants, katsuya, the first of which just opened in brentwood.dominic ngchairman, east west bank; 47, pasadenang has taken ethnic banking mainstream. at east west, founded in chinatown in 1973 and now the second-largest commercial bank based in southern california, the staff greets customers in spanish and vietnamese as well as cantonese, mandarin and english. the company's stock price has tripled this decade. meanwhile, ng raised record funds for the united way of greater los angeles by bringing in new donors, solidifying his leadership in philanthropy as well as finance.henry t. ""nick"" nicholas iiiinvestor; philanthropist; cofounder, broadcom corp.; 46, newport coastthough best known for his gigantic ego, intense work style and high-profile marital problems, there's no doubting the import of nicholas' influence. with broadcom cofounder samueli, he helped give orange county a new high-tech gloss. and as a local philanthropist, he's heaped millions on the arts and a range of education and technology projects. the billionaire has also donated vast sums to law-and-order causes, his interest stemming from his sister's murder 23 years ago. nicholas is credited, in particular, with fending off an overhaul of the state's three-strikes law.bart o'brienplant guru // 50, uplandin 16 years as a senior horticulturalist at rancho santa ana botanic garden in claremont, the harvard-educated o'brien has achieved a cult following for his ideas on redefining beauty in the garden. out with chinese gardenias, in with california lilac. no one has done more to bring the glory of our native flora to the attention of nurseries, landscapers and gardeners. drive down any street in southern california and where lawn gives way to penstemons, monkeyflowers and poppies, an o'brien convert can be found.ronald l. olsonpartner, munger, tolles & olson;65, pasadenahis clients have ranged from the filipino government to warren buffett, but at home in l.a., he's one of the most sought-after power lawyers around. olson played a key role in minimizing damage to southern california edison during the energy crisis of 2001, and defended mike ovitz and his severance package against walt disney co. shareholders. he represented merrill lynch in the orange county bankruptcy and brad grey when his name came up in the anthony pellicano investigation. recently, the getty trust called on him amid its scandal.alexandra patsavasmusic supervisor // 38, pasadenaone snippet of a song playing in the background while, say, seth pines for summer on ""the oc"" and--boom--an indie rock star is born. patsavas, who picks songs for the hit show (as well as for ""grey's anatomy,"" ""without a trace"" and ""rescue me"") has become one of the most powerful gatekeepers in the entertainment business. each week she is deluged with cds from record labels, band managers and artists.anthony pellicanoprivate detective; 62, u.s. metropolitan detention center, los angeleshe's behind bars, where clout tends to be hard to come by. but information, as they say, is power, and pellicano--alleged wiretapper to the stars for more than a decade--has amassed reams of it in his long service to the city's most high-profile entertainment figures and their lawyers. in fact, one reason this list is short on l.a. attorneys is that so many have seen their power eroded because of the probe into pellicano, who--so far at least--claims not to have talked to the authorities.a. jerrold perenchiooutgoing chairman, univision communications inc.; 75, beverly hills""zelig-like"" was the way a recent times profile described perenchio's involvement in entertainment, politics and sports in the region (and nationally). he built univision into the nation's dominant spanish-language broadcaster, and recently sold out to an investment group that includes haim saban. his personal take is estimated at about $1.3 billion, leaving him poised to increase his philanthropic power. by some estimates, perenchio--malibu's largest landowner--has already given away many millions to disney hall, ucla and others. the ronald reagan ucla medical center, it is said, probably wouldn't be getting built without him. but quantifying his contributions isn't easy because perenchio's preference is to remain far under the radar.curt pringleanaheim mayor; 47, anaheimpringle has taken some heat for having lost anaheim's name- change fight with the angels and for struggling to muster consensus on courting the nfl. still, pringle is not only running unopposed, he's also been endorsed by his biggest critic. it's a testament to the skill and war chest of the ambitious gop leader of disneyland's hometown. more broadly, pringle has built such a strong reputation for his aggressive pro-business approach to governance (creative tax waivers, sweeping zone changes, market incentives to redevelop run- down parts of the city) that other local officials have coined a verb for his philosophy: ""to pringle-ize.""david pyottchairman and ceo, allergan inc.;52, san juan capistranohe's the man who took botox mainstream. it has been more than 15 years since allergan bought the rights to an obscure little treatment for eye spasms. when pyott became ceo in 1998, few outside the hollywood underground knew that botox could also smooth wrinkles. pyott ramped up spending on research and development, got the fda to approve botox for cosmetic uses and has marketed it so aggressively that it's all but a way of life in looks-conscious southern california. allergan's next possible blockbuster: juvederm, a dermal filler that reduces the appearance of lines and folds.connie ricelawyer; 50, altadenaan l.a. civil rights attorney (and the second cousin of secretary of state condi), she has weighed in on transportation, race relations and dysfunction within the lausd, among other things. most recently she chaired the blue ribbon rampart review panel, charged with providing a final accounting of the notorious police corruption scandal. as is rice's style, the report throws down a gauntlet, calling for an expansion of the lapd and an end to the culture of ""warrior police.""ramona ripstonexecutive director, aclu of southern california;

(he even has an investment in sunset photo and news.) ross also has a kids' store, an internet business, a soon-to-open men's store and a coming shoe line.edward ruschaartist; 69, venicewith surprisingly resonant images of otherwise banal subjects such as standard gas stations, a norms restaurant, the hollywood sign, parking lots and the sunset strip, ruscha has personified ""l.a. artist"" since the mid-1950s. perennially popular, he has gained increasing respect in the last decade, and in 2005 represented the united states at the venice biennale. this year, the l.a. county museum of art purchased 156 works from ruscha in an effort to acquire a complete set of his prints, while the museum of contemporary art elected him to its board of trustees.esa-pekka salonencomposer; conductor and music director, l.a. philharmonic; 48, los angelesthe dashing finn was a rising star when he arrived here 14 years ago. since then, he has matured into one of the world's most impressive conductors and composers, while turning the l.a. phil into the hippest, hottest cultural ticket in town. thanks to the orchestra's with-it image, the classical music audiences in disney hall are now urban, edgy, diverse--nothing like the dowdy crowds of yore.steven b. samplepresident, usc; 65, san marinoonce usc was branded the university of spoiled children. no longer. under sample's leadership, usc has become a magnet for foreign students, with nobel laureates on the faculty, average sat scores that rival ucla's and influential institutions such as the annenberg school for communication and the marshall school of business. sample is also a force on l.a. civic issues, reaching out to help develop the low-income neighborhoods around the campus.arnold schwarzeneggercalifornia governor; actor;59, brentwoodit's good to be the governator. good for southern kollyfornia too. though schwarzenegger is, of course, in charge of the entire state, his ties here create a special ripple effect. his bond initiative to buttress the state's infrastructure would, if it passes, have a disproportionate local impact. many of his closest advisors hail from the southland. and schwarzenegger's election has dramatically raised the profile of his republican backers in orange county's new majority.henry segerstromdeveloper; 83, newport beachthe patriarch of one of orange county's leading farm families, segerstrom famously turned a tract of bean fields into south coast plaza. the rest, as they say, is history. segerstrom has also been the major force behind the o.c. performing arts center, which will expand into a new hall in september--named, naturally, for the man and his family.muzammil siddiqireligious director, islamic societyof orange county; 62, fountain valleysiddiqi, whose mosque is among the largest in north america, is the religious leader of thousands of southern california muslims at a time when xenophobia is running high. after sept. 11, the white house invited him to preside over interfaith services at the national cathedral. since then, he has been a leader in driving home the point that muslims in the u.s. are peace-loving.nancy silvertonchef; restaurateur; 52, hancock parka big percentage of the current generation of l.a.'s chefs came from silverton's kitchen at campanile (which she founded with her ex- husband mark peel, who now pilots the place solo). with her weekly sandwich nights there, antipasto nights at la terza and mozzarella nights at jar, she's changed the way angelenos eat. she was the first baker to give all of l.a. access to artisan bread (at her la brea bakery, sold in 2001 for $56 million). and the restaurant she's about to open with mario batali, mozza, is the most highly anticipated in years.emily simonitschsenior vp, house of blues concerts;

35, los angeleswhen congress threatened to crack down on undocumented immigrants, sotelo--l.a.'s top-ranked morning deejay--gave organizers of a proposed pro-immigrant rally four hours on his program on ksca-fm (101.9). sotelo then worked with kbue-fm (105.5) host ricardo ""el mandril"" sanchez and others to pump up the volume. urging protesters to carry american flags and to be peaceful, the deejays summoned half a million or more to l.a.'s streets.steven spielbergmovie director; cofounder dreamworks skg; 59, pacific palisadesbeyond moviemaking, spielberg is perhaps best known as a worldwide force in jewish philanthropy. but his local impact is significant too. he has established a repository of 52,000 testimonies of holocaust survivors at usc, as well as given to the film school there. he has also been an active donor to the cedars- sinai medical center. the virtual megaphone attached to his fame, though, is his chief source of influence, and most any cause he champions (think driving a prius to the oscars) can become an instant trend, first in show business circles and then beyond.kevin starrhistory professor, usc; state librarian emeritus; author; 65, san franciscostarr's influence may ultimately last longer than anybody's on this list, because he is helping us to interpret what it means to be southern californians. some have criticized starr for being too boosterish. but his ""americans and the california dream"" series of books--now standing at six volumes, with nearly 10,000 pages--is dazzling in its breadth and depth of knowledge.marc sternfinancial executive; 62, malibustern has been the quintessential l.a. insider for decades, having served as the right hand to eli broad and robert day. he also has been a caltech trustee--long a position held by the real lions of los angeles--and an influential force in the arts world as chairman of the los angeles opera and a director of the performing arts center of l.a. county.caroline styneco-owner and wine director, aoc and lucques; 39, hancock parkchef suzanne goin's rustic-yet-refined cooking aesthetic is reason enough to frequent lucques and aoc, but it's styne's impressive range of wines by the glass that has shaken up the local restaurant world. before styne, l.a.'s wine scene was all about cult cabs and chardonnay. but she has inspired sommeliers at restaurants citywide to dare angelenos into becoming more adventurous drinkers and spawned a burgeoning wine-bar movement.trader joe's tasting panel, monroviawe cannot name them. we cannot show their faces. otherwise, trader joe would have to kill us, and that would mean no more chili lime peanuts and two-buck chuck for us. what we can say is that there are more than 10 of them and fewer than 40, and they're easily the most powerful group of food critics in southern california. the monrovia-based grocery chain has more weirdly addictive foods--and a more cult-like fan base--than probably any supermarket nationally. the reason is its expert tasting panel, which meets daily in secret to determine down to the last package of mandarin orange chicken what will go on the shelves of trader joe's groceries, which now number 256 in 20 states, including 82 stores regionally.peter ueberrothmanaging director, contrarian group inc.;

59, san marinowardlaw was a key advisor to two of the last three mayors, and he put l.a. councilman bernard parks through mock oral exams the first time he was running for lapd chief. he's a friend of supervisor zev yaroslavsky and has the ear of sen. dianne feinstein. wardlaw's clout has waned since villaraigosa's election--he had chaired james hahn's reelection campaign--but not much. the reason? he's an old friend of villaraigosa too. most importantly, the freeman spogli & co. attorney understands the crucial nexus in l.a. between democratic politics, labor politics and ethnic politics.rev. rick warrenpastor, saddleback church; 52, trabuco canyonhis congregation now numbers more than 20,000 and his weekend services are attended by one out of every nine people in south o.c. but that's all multiplied by the way the hawaiian-shirted warren deploys his flock, sending them out to enlist others in good works. bigger than harvest christian fellowship's greg laurie, cooler than crystal cathedral's robert schuller, people-friendlier than calvary chapel's chuck smith, warren is in a class by himself. and then there's his book, ""the purpose driven life.""kevin weatherlykroq-fm (106.7) program director;

57, los angelescounty supervisors have a virtual lifetime tenure and, as the representative of west los angeles, yaroslavsky has the added advantage of being popular in a district that boasts prodigious wealth. critics complain that he hangs back, but when he chooses to exert his force on an issue, it has an impact. supporters of disney hall say the project might never have been completed without his backing. meanwhile, the county has come to rely on him as an important playmaker on the entrenched and politically polarized board of supes. he's also one of the few county officials with national connections and clout.message no: 43235caption: photo: a look at the most powerful people in southern california, drawn from a wide range of arenas: politics, business, the arts, entertainment, media, education, the environment and beyond. we rank the top 10, and then give you the next 90.;

""i'm ready to excuse every democratic candidate for the things they said about me. i'm ready to turn that page.""yanukovich soon chimed in with similar appeals to voters. ""they thought they could make promises from election to election and not fulfill the promises, that people will forget,"" he said of tymoshenko and her allies.the improbable reversal of yanukovich's fortune points up the changes that have rattled ukraine in past years.the last time ukrainians voted for a president, in 2004, yanukovich won but his victory was tarnished by allegations of vote rigging. enraged crowds stormed into the streets to demand his ouster, and the orange revolution was born.the ensuing seasons have been tumultuous and often painful for ukraine. the politicians who had marched boldly through the frigid streets calling for a reinvented ukraine were now in office -- and promptly lost themselves in byzantine power plays, internecine wars and flashy shows of dubiously acquired wealth.meanwhile, the economic crisis under president viktor yushchenko has hammered the country, radically devaluing the currency and spreading unemployment and uncertainty throughout the provinces.""people are feeling that they've been lied to,"" said larisa kuchuba, a 60-year-old engineer who braved snow and thick blankets of black ice sunday to vote in south kiev.kuchuba cast her vote for one of the lesser-known opposition candidates. she didn't believe he stood the slightest chance of winning; her vote was cast in protest, she said.""the politicians did everything to keep one another from succeeding. they didn't do anything for the success of the country,"" she said. ""all they did was fight.""analysts warned that the presidency would be a bitterly fought-for prize, with the candidates accusing one another of fraud and going to court. the battle could drag on for months beyond the runoff.with the exit of yushchenko, whose approval ratings wallowed in the single digits in recent months, ukraine loses a president who strove to shake off the grip of moscow and reorient ukraine as a westernized land with strong allies in brussels and washington.but in a country where many people grow up speaking russian and feel nostalgically, culturally and religiously intertwined with russia, yushchenko's approach chafed nerves -- and eventually backfired as his opponents blamed him for the dangerous deterioration of relations with moscow.the kremlin now appears poised to restore some of its lost influence in ukraine because both leading candidates have friendly relations with russian leaders.in the years since the orange revolution, the very word ""orange"" lost its linguistic role as proud shorthand for the leaders who presented themselves as pro-western reformers and became an adjective generally uttered with a grimace or a roll of the eyes.its affections historically split between russia and europe, ukraine became a coveted battleground for influence between russia and the u.s., which heartily backed its drift away from moscow.but even that status was lost: ukraine found its foreign policy importance downgraded as president obama sought to ease tensions with the kremlin.",

1678440923,Washington Post The,2015-05-05,General Information,HEALTH,Salt,E.1,1617,Pass the salt,"salt intake that is often deemed high may actually have benefits, scientists say.""we humans eat more salt than is necessary. but we all do it. so the question is: why?"" asks paul breslin, a professor of nutritional sciences who researches sodium appetite at new jersey's rutgers university.in the past, people thought that salt boosted health - so much so that the latin word for ""health"" - ""salus"" - was derived from ""sal"" (salt). in medieval times, salt was prescribed to treat a multitude of conditions, including toothaches, stomachaches and ""heaviness of mind.""while governments have long pushed people to reduce their intakes of sodium chloride (table salt) to prevent high blood pressure, stroke and coronary heart disease, there are good reasons why cutting down on salt is not an easy thing to do.scientists suggest that sodium intake may have physiological benefits that make salt particularly tempting - and ditching the salt shaker difficult. it comes down to evolution.""in biology, if something is attractive and we invest in gaining it, it must be beneficial, adaptive in evolutionary terms,"" says micah leshem, a professor of psychology at haifa university in israel, who spent decades researching salt's unique appeal.people tend to consume about the same amount of sodium no matter where they live, and this amount hasn't changed much in decades. those facts hint at the biological basis of our sodium appetite.a 2014 analysis of data that spanned 50 years and dozens of countries (including the united states, france, china and several african nations, including zimbabwe and south africa) found that the quantity of sodium that most people consume (and then excrete) falls into a historically narrow range of 2.6 to 4.8 grams per day. (and then there are extremes: in 16th-century sweden, for example, people ate 100 grams a day, mostly from fish that had been salted to preserve it.)""over the last five decades, salt content of commercial food in our food [in the united states] has gone up. but if you look at people's 24-hour urinary sodium excretion, you see that the amounts of salt people consume have been constant,"" he says. irrespective of age, sex or race, between 1957 and 2003 americans have been eating on average 3.5 grams of salt a day. ""this suggests that we are somehow regulating the amount of salt we are eating,"" breslin says.and, in fact, salt is good for us. sodium is necessary for preventing dehydration, for proper transmission of nerve impulses and for normal functioning of cells. if we ate no sodium at all, we would die. when they become sodium-deficient, many animals go out of their way to find the mineral. that's why, for example, sweaty clothes of alpinists tend to attract mountain goats.sodium depletion can develop after severe sweating, diarrhea or vomiting or, if you are a lab rat, after it is induced by a scientist. pharmacology professor alan kim johnson and colleagues from the university of iowa gave rats diuretics and found that sodium-depleted rodents acquired a strong attraction for salted chips. in other experiments, sodium-deficient animals hungrily drank ultra-salty solutions that they would otherwise find disgusting.lifetime cravingsonce sodium deficiency is experienced, salt cravings can last a lifetime. that happens with humans, too - but only if the deficiency strikes in very early childhood, or even before birth.if your mother suffered frequent vomiting in pregnancy or if you lost significant amounts of sodium as a baby (due to vomiting or diarrhea, for example), chances are good that you eat more salt than other people do, even by as much as 50 percent, as one of leshem's studies has shown. this is probably because sodium depletion alters our central nervous system so that we develop long-lasting preference for the mineral, johnson says.in one of leshem's studies, babies who had low concentrations of sodium in their blood in the first weeks of their lives grew up to be teenagers with a penchant for salt, even salt that is seemingly hidden in processed foods. ""even if you can't taste the salt, apparently your body does. it's working on an unconscious level to condition a preference for sodium,"" leshem explains.this makes sense from an evolutionary perspective, says daniel fessler, a ucla anthropologist: if a mother or her infant experiences sodium hunger, it could mean that salt is hard to come by in their environment - and so it is better to be on a constant lookout for it. that is also how humans may have evolved their general liking of salt, johnson says: ""mankind spent a lot of evolutionary history on the hot african savanna where salt was very scarce and readily lost from the body. since severe sodium depletion can cause circulatory collapse, there was a selection for mechanisms to save sodium and to drive us to consume more of it.""a calming effect?eating salt may also help calm us, or reduce our stress. in animal studies, the effects are pretty clear. an experiment published in 1995 showed, for example, that when rats are put in stressful situations, they choose to drink salty water rather than unsalted water. in another study, when wild rabbits were stressed, their sodium intake shot up.the possibly stress-reducing, or mood-enhancing, effects of salt in humans are not as well documented, but there is some evidence. in a 2014 study involving about 10,000 americans, leshem and his colleagues found a relationship between salt intake and depression: women whose diets were high in sodium were less depressed than other women. ""maybe people are self-medicating with salt,"" he reasons. ""but that's a small effect; salt is not going to cure anyone of depression.""breslin believes there may be another evolution-based reason why we love salt: ""salt accelerates sexual maturation in animal models, resulting in more offspring,"" he says. male rats on high-sodium diets, for example, have increased sperm counts. and in a 1991 experiment, men whose sodium intake was lowered to 2.4 grams a day complained of erectile dysfunction more often than those who consumed three grams a day. ""the most problematic was a combination of a diuretic and a low-sodium diet,"" says epidemiologist sylvia wassertheil-smoller, the study's lead author.what's more, women from the yanomami tribe in brazil, famed for their low salt intake (23 milligrams per day - less than 1 percent of what the average american consumes), have fewer children than could be expected, and they often miscarry. yet according to tilman drueke, a nephrologist who researches fertility and sodium intake at the french institute of health and medical research, this observation should be taken ""with a grain of salt"" because, he says, ""the relatively low fertility and high rate of pregnancy loss in yanomami women clearly cannot be attributed to their very low salt intake alone. this is only one hypothesis among several others, including the higher prevalence of infectious diseases.""it's also possible that sodium aids growth. as scientists from new jersey medical school found out, if you put rats on low-salt diets, their bones and muscles fail to grow as fast as they normally would. in one of his experiments, leshem found that children in general reach for more salt than adults do - independent of calorie intake - which may be explained by the needs of their growing bodies.finally, there are a few diseases that can turn a few of us into salt gluttons. about 15 percent of people with adrenal insufficiency (addison's disease) - which can cause weakness, anemia and low blood pressure - experience acute salt cravings. hiding saltshakers from them may not be a good idea.in 1940 the case of a little boy was described in the journal of the american medical association. from the time he was a year old, the boy would go out of his way to eat massive amounts of salt. when he started speaking, one of his first words was ""salt."" during a hospital stay (unrelated to his dietary habits), he was put on a low-sodium diet. to prevent him from sneaking around the hospital and stealing salt, he was strapped to his bed. he soon died. the reason? due to severe and undiagnosed cortico-adrenal insufficiency, his kidneys were unable to retain sodium. only eating huge amounts of salt had kept the boy alive.salt sensitivityyet most of us do not need huge amounts of salt to survive. just the opposite: about half of humans are what is called salt-sensitive: if they consume lots of sodium, their blood pressure will go up. but if we do have internal regulatory mechanisms that tell us to load up on salt when our bodies need it (for growth, for mood improvement or to simply prevent dehydration), does it even make sense to encourage people to try to reduce their dietary sodium? it does, breslin says, but only to a point.""if people are regulating their sodium intakes, they are not going to be able to reduce it a lot - say, by 50 percent or more. it would be like putting someone in a room and cutting the amount of oxygen by half: your body will try to maintain the level of oxygen in your blood and will make you breathe faster."" and so, as johnson suggests, when it comes to salt intake, ""moderation is probably ideal.""cut your sodium intake if your health condition requires it and your doctor recommends it, but don't look at salt as an evil that should be banned from your plate completely: there may be valid reasons why your body craves it.zaraska is a writer based in france.",

""to have the show embraced so wholeheartedly from america is a great thrill for all of us.""downton returns in january for a third season, and ""this season,"" says creator julian fellowes, ""in a way is about the recovery from (world war i).  that's really the kind of theme of the season. there are chills and thrills involved for all the characters.""and this year joining those characters is cora's (elizabeth mcgovern) american mother -- played by shirley maclaine, who said sharing a news conference saturday with the other actors was like ""being back with my family. it was an extraordinary experience for me, also for stamina and work ethic. we were shooting outside in the wind and the rain with our formal gear on and nobody seemed to notice, so i quickly stepped in there and acted like i didn't notice, either.""with the war  behind it, downton is entering the 1920s -- and that, says fellowes, is where it will stay; he has no interest to push forward to the '30s. ""the '20s are a far more nebulous time,"" he says. ""i think it's rather fun to be journeying through that stuff. (i) think we'll be moving fairly slowly.""a new 'neighborhood'a new generation of neighbors is moving into mister rogers' neighborhood. premiering sept. 3, daniel tiger's neighborhood is an animated extension of the late fred rogers' beloved pbs classic.the star in this new half-hour weekday series, aimed at children ages 2 to 4, is daniel tiger, 4-year-old son of daniel striped tiger, rogers' first puppet. he and his friends, all sons and daughters of rogers' original puppet characters, go through adventures and sing songs meant to teach social skills.produced by the fred rogers company, the show arrives with the cooperation and blessing of rogers' widow, joanne rogers. ""my feeling is he would really be pleased with this,"" she says.unlike the original show, which was built around rogers as our guide to the land of make believe, daniel is led by an animated tiger cub. joanne rogers had originally hoped to find a human host to step into her husband's tennis shoes, but, she says, ""there is nobody else. it really is as simple as that. fred didn't spend much time worrying about that when he was alive, because he thought there were people who might be possibilities. but it just didn't work.""and while the old neighborhood used puppets instead of cartoons, that's not because fred rogers was opposed to animation, she says. ""he looked into it. it just never happened. he liked the idea of having some animation.""burns visits 'dust bowl'in his national parks series, ken burns chronicled the natural beauty of our land. next, the historian-director serves up a  slice of its potential for horror.the dust bowl, a two-part film airing on pbs nov. 18-19, is an oral history of the devastating storms that struck the southwest in the 1930s, spawned by a deadly combination of overfarming and drought.  he calls it a ""cautionary tale.""""this is the story of the greatest man-made ecological disaster in american history, a 10-year apocalypse,"" he says. and hitting at the height of the great depression, he says, left ""an epic of human pain and suffering.""the storms swept across oklahoma, colorado and the rest of the southwest, where there could be miles between houses. the residents had never seen anything like it. ""the isolation was so complete,  you can imagine what it would be like for one of these mountain ranges coming toward you and not knowing what it was,"" he says. many of them thought it was the end of the world. ""i don't know how they survived.  (i) don't know how they understood what was going on.""photo by frederick m. brown, getty images; extraordinary experienc elizabeth mcgovern, left, with shirley maclaine, who joins the downton abbey cast next season.; caption:",

432653848,New York Times,2004-01-22,News,F,Interior design,F.1,1588,"From Paris Castoffs, A Recherche Retreat","''everything has been rescued in one form or another,'' said catherine levy, referring to the toy trunk she uses as a bench in her apartment here, her mismatched dining room chairs, the white enamel counter in her kitchen. almost everything in her 860-square-foot apartment, not far from the bastille, is meant to amuse. ms. levy is one half of tse & tse, a design partnership created in 1991 when she and sigolene prebois joined forces. playful interpretations of everyday objects (their row of test tubes known as the april vase; their light garlands of tiny bulbs dressed in colorful bows or paper cubes) have made tse & tse a hot name on the french contemporary design scene.they are not to be confused, however, with the french designer augustine tse and his tse fashion label; nor should they be confused with the fly that causes sleeping sickness, although that's what inspired the name. ''we wanted a name that could be separated into two parts,'' ms. levy said, by way of explanation.whether people understand the name or not, the company's wares are showing up all over the globe. their lighting and housewares are a sensation in japan. tse & tse's exploding circle of fairy lights, which sold for around $90 at habitat in london, was singled out as a fabulous holiday decoration by four british newspapers.inside modern living in toronto sells the tse & tse floor-to-ceiling totem pole carved birchwood storage unit. ''think of it as a tree with branches that hold vases, lamps, wire picture holders or metal shelves,'' said daniel aguacil, the store's owner, who is a fan of their work. in new york their housewares are at clio, karkula (the former breukelen) and at conran's.ms. levy's home, which she shares with her boyfriend, christophe prebois, a photographer and her business partner's brother, looks onto a quiet street a few blocks behind the bastille opera, a derelict neighborhood until a decade ago when it was pioneered by bobos -- france, too, has its bourgeois bohemians.the apartment shares the tse & tse aesthetic, where familiar items have been inventively repurposed. sitting at a table that was once a long wooden counter used in a textile shop for unrolling lengths of fabric, ms. levy explained how she found the chairs for the table -- several different shapes and sizes, now painted in bright colors -- on the street or at cheap flea markets as far a way as prague.''i don't believe i have ever bought a new piece of anything,'' she said, pointing out a metal file cabinet used as shelving, wooden crates that form a coffee table and pieces of hand-printed fabric from her sister's textile company, maison georgette, that she has hung to create a wardrobe in the bedroom.''i find it an amusing exercise to make use of what one has or comes across, to never succumb to a conforama or brico depot,'' she said, referring to the french equivalent of the home depot or lowe's. ''i've managed to carry the most impossible things onto airplanes,'' she said, including an entire standing closet that she carried back, in pieces, from japan. she found it at the salvation army in tokyo for $53.''shipping it would have cost a fortune,'' she said. ''it was either get it on the plane or leave it in the street.''ms. levy, 39, also collects fabrics when traveling -- mostly to india (where tse & tse produces some of its products) and japan. she brings the fabrics back to a tailor here who transforms them into the basic clothing she likes: long skirt, shirts that wrap or tie, shawls.ms. levy's clothing is like an album of her business trips. and she keeps extensive notebooks to catalog what she saw but could not bring back. in fact, tse & tse used a collage of pages from ms. levy's notebook to design a fabric print for the japanese fashion designer issey miyake.''everything we've designed has come out of a desire for pleasure,'' ms. levy said. ''we try to always amuse ourselves.'' she and ms. prebois made their porcelain and glass tableware (which includes dishes, carafes, bowls, goblets and cups in curvaceous, slightly asymmetrical forms) because they themselves needed plates.''we really liked them and so did our friends, so they became a tse & tse product,'' ms. levy said, adding as if it were unthinkable, ''we certainly didn't just sit down and say, 'let's make tableware.' ''ms. levy and ms. prebois were still students at the newly created ecole nationale superieure de creation industrielle when they began collaborating. the school was founded as an experiment, with no set curriculum, in 1983 by jacques lang, then the minister of culture. many successful french designers now in their 30's and 40's are products of the school, including jean-marie massaud, matali crasset and patrick jouin.''it was considered very experimental at the time,'' said francoise jollant kneebone, who was director of the school from 1998 to 2001. ''there was a lot of media coverage.''while still at school ms. levy and ms. prebois created a rubber jewelry collection that became a mini sensation in paris. ''we were cute and young, so the press loved us,'' said ms. levy, who grew up in the preppy 16th arrondissement here and remembers standing out from the other children. (for one thing, she wore coats her progressive mother brought back from afghanistan.)pierre romanet, director of the sentou galleries in paris began selling tse & tse products 10 years ago. he refers to the two as designers ''who are also artists -- which gives them that extra plus.''the much lamented store shi was the first in new york to discover the tse & tse aesthetic. ''when shi stopped selling them, she passed them on to me,'' said john erik, the owner of karkula, as if tse & tse was a precious resource not to be squandered. ''they create things that look superprecious, but they are very affordable.'' a case in point, he said, is their ink bowls. ''beautiful, food-safe bowls, a set of five, made of paper and covered in the natural resin of an african tree,'' he said. ''they look like wet black ink. a set of five is $125.''many tse & tse products have become contemporary classics of parisian homes. one is the glass flower vase hanging from the ceiling in a teardrop form (tse & tse designed the original, which has been much copied); another is its tiny igloo of porcelain for burning votive candles, and yet another, its porcelain fruit bowl with silver or gold interior or exterior. once considered the kiddies of the french design scene, the women are now so mainstream that they have designed for habitat and baccarat.ms. levy's style for furnishing her apartment reflects a poetic eye and a playful design aesthetic. her sofa from morocco is made of braided reeds, and she uses the wooden toy trunk from her childhood as a bench. a charles eames rocking chair was acquired for its light-hearted design. she liked the shape of a watchmaker's bench (curved to prevent delicate pieces from falling) and turned it into a shelf. her kitchen counter, which has a white enamel top, once stood in a medical laboratory.ms. levy stores her bed linens on a shelf above her bed in a row of nylon bags from southern india. the shelf was made from wood decorated with arabic lettering found in the street. and just below the ceiling in the living room are strings of lights in various sizes and shapes collected from europe and asia, including, of course, india.this fall, the french publisher seuil will bring out a book called ''cent % indian,'' devoted to ms. levy's collection of utilitarian indian objects. these playful light bulbs, radios and kitchen utensils were created under laws, since lifted, that promoted home-grown indian industries.and when those brightly colored lights around the ceiling burn out, what will she do? ''find something else that amuses me,'' she said.finding tse & tse''i love their work -- so well designed and so much fun,'' said michelle lehmann, an owner of clio in new york, which carries tse & tse vases, plates, hungry serving forks (below; platinum tips $76; all porcelain, $59), trays, votives and the tse & tse mirza teapot ($108; left). ''it's the most interestingly designed teapot i've ever seen,'' ms. lehmann said. ''it's art.'' clio, 92 thompson street (spring); (212) 966-8991.john erik, who owns karkula, carries tse & tse bowls, porcelain dishware and lamps. the set of five ink bowls costs $125.

433960340,New York Times,2008-10-04,Commentary,A,Peace,A.18,437,Mr. Olmert's Belated Truths,"ehud olmert, israel's soon to be ex-prime minister, voiced some startling truths this week. he said that in exchange for peace, israel should withdraw from ""almost all"" of the west bank and share its capital city, jerusalem, with the palestinians. he also said that as part of a negotiated peace deal with syria, israel should be ready to give up the golan heights.it's frustrating that mr. olmert, who is stepping down as prime minister after being accused of corruption, waited so long to say these things. and it is tragic that he did not do more to act on those beliefs when he had real power.his statements in a farewell interview with the newspaper yediot ahronoth  were unlike anything any israeli political leader had dared to say -- at least publicly -- before. he also dismissed as ""megalomania"" any suggestion that israel should act by itself to destroy iran's nuclear program.there always has been far too wide a gap between mr. olmert's belief that israel's security and demographic survival depends on a two-state solution and what he has been willing to do to get such a deal. the palestinian president, mahmoud abbas, also has not shown nearly enough political courage. the result is that while the two men have been negotiating since the american-led annapolis peace conference last fall, very little progress has been made.there are, of course, many fraught issues to solve: drawing permanent boundaries that give israel defensible frontiers and the palestinians an economically viable state; finding a way for both states to claim jerusalem as their capital; and compensating and resettling palestinian refugees in the new palestinian state.but mr. olmert was never willing to take even the tactical steps needed to improve the lives of ordinary palestinians and give them a real stake in peace: fully freezing the expansion of jewish settlements and sufficiently reducing the roadblocks in the west bank that are strangling the palestinian economy. although a discredited messenger, mr. olmert still deserves credit for putting the most sensitive issues on the table and identifying the only viable formula for a peace agreement.tzipi livni, mr. olmert's designated successor, has been israel's chief negotiator for the past year. it is unlikely that she will show any candor while she tries to put together a coalition government. but we hope that she takes mr. olmert's truths to heart. and we hope she is willing to do what is needed to build a lasting peace.",

434085489,New York Times,2009-05-05,Review,C,Classical music,C.6,472,"Resilience of the Human Spirit, in Song","the mezzo-soprano anne sofie von otter has a knack for creating coherently themed programs, especially on her cds. bengt forsberg, a pianist and ms. von otter's regular accompanist, likes to champion lesser-known, underperformed composers. the violinist daniel hope takes pains to connect the music he plays to broader social and cultural issues. all three inclinations were fruitfully combined in ""terezin-theresienstadt,"" the fascinating, deeply moving program these artists presented with daniel muller-schott, a cellist, at zankel hall on saturday night.the music, much of it included on a cd of the same title issued by deutsche grammophon last year, was primarily written by composers interned at theresienstadt, a concentration camp near prague. despite perilous circumstances and constant degradation, art flourished in the camp, a fact the nazis eventually used for propaganda.at either end of the program was a plaintive song by ilse weber, a gifted poet and author who became a nurse at the camp, before she was sent to her death at auschwitz. ""ich wandre durch theresienstadt,"" which opened the concert, spoke to a desperate longing for freedom and home. ""wiegala,"" the tender lullaby that ended the program, was a haunting paean to nocturnal silence.what came between spoke to the resilience of the human spirit, even as it endures the unthinkable. there was a mordant humor in karel svenk's ""vsechno jde"" (""anything goes,"" also known as the ""terezin march"") and in an anonymous recasting of a selection from kalman's operetta ""grafin mariza.""viktor ullmann's ""beryozkele"" (""birch tree""), sung in yiddish, and zikmund schul's ""two chassidic dances,"" for violin (originally viola) and cello, showed that the nazi depredations had actually intensified a sense of jewish identity among artists and other intellectuals in the camp.still other works by ullmann, pavel haas and karel berman (the sole composer in the program who survived the war) proved that these composers were versed in the latest international styles and trends.bartok's spirit hovered over two works by erwin schulhoff, a czech composer who was never in theresienstadt but died in the nearby wulzburg camp. his duo for violin and cello, from 1925, featured beguiling blends of timbre and a technically dazzling zingaresca movement. the violin sonata no. 2, written two years later, was lean, muscular and energetic.always a lucid, insightful interpreter, ms. von otter found the expressive heart of everything she sang. mr. forsberg, mr. hope and mr. muller-schott were superb collaborators. a running commentary from the performers usefully illuminated the unimaginable circumstances under which this affecting music was created.terezin-theresienstadt: anne sofie von otter, right, and the pianist bengt forsberg at zankel hall on saturday.(photograph by hiroyuki ito for the new york times)",

""these students have free speech rights.""the fraternity organizer, pascal de maria, now a senior, said he did not believe anti-semitism was involved.chapman spokeswoman mary platt said the letter was under review and that some student contentions were untrue, such as being prohibited from wearing fraternity t-shirts.""they've been wearing those shirts all semester. there has been no action taken. that's ridiculous,"" she said. ""the university's only aim throughout all this is to assure that this group, as with any group, does not call itself an officially sanctioned chapman organization when it's not, because . . . it leaves the university with considerable liability.""the controversy's roots are more than 2 years old, when de maria and some friends decided to create a campus chapter of sigma alpha mu, a historically jewish fraternity. the students began recruiting members and meeting with university officials in spring 2005 about the application process. in april 2006, the university allowed a fraternity to set up on campus but turned down several, including sigma alpha mu.at the same time, the group's national organization gave the students ""colony"" status, a step below chapter status, and the chapman students began wearing t-shirts emblazoned with the greek letters on campus.in september 2006, joseph kertes and administrator chris hutchinson sent de maria a letter ordering him to stop advertising fraternity events on campus and forbade him to hold fraternity events on campus or meeting at chapman before heading to off-campus events.they also said the group must clearly indicate that it is not affiliated with chapman and request that the national organization send a letter to university officials stating that there is no chapter at the campus, and to agree to carry insurance coverage for chapman students who associate with the local fraternity.the letter was sent to several administrators, as well as the leaders of the university's sanctioned fraternities and sororities.chapman also sent leaders of these groups letters urging them to report to university officials if de maria or the other sigma alpha mu members were seen congregating on campus or wearing their t- shirts, villagra said.""i felt like a prisoner at the school i go to,"" de maria said.platt said she could not comment on the september 2006 letter because it would violate de maria's privacy rights.the university's decision to distribute the letter to other students is the subject of a complaint de maria filed with the federal government.she said the group was offered the option of becoming a school club, which is a much simpler process than becoming a fraternity.the only difference is that the group would have to admit any man or woman who applied, she said.the aclu letter does not question the university's decision to deny the group its imprimatur but seeks a retraction of the restrictions in the september 2006 letter, as well as expunging students' records of anything relating to the fraternity issue.villagra said that the restrictions were applied only to sigma alpha mu and not to any other unauthorized group that claims a chapman affiliation, such as the assn. of intellegentpot smokers and the under age drinkers (cu chapter), both of which assert school affiliation on their facebook pages.platt said university officials lacked the resources to police the internet.villagra said if the university failed to act, the aclu would consider suing.de maria said he would be happy if his group could do what other fraternal groups do -- play ultimate frisbee on the quad and hold meetings, charity benefits and social events.""we have no intention of making the university angry or provoking them,"" he said.""we really just wanted to associate ourselves with a brotherhood.""",
410138563,Washington Post The,2007-07-26,Commentary,EDITORIAL,Fuel economy standards,A.20,594,Leadership Needed; Higher fuel economy standards may be doomed without Nancy Pelosi's support.,"there is a pitched battle underway in the house of representatives over whether to introduce an amendment to increase the corporate average fuel economy (cafe) standard in the energy package due to hit the floor before congress takes off for its august recess. while one camp is eager to follow the senate's aggressive boost in cafe requirements for the first time since 1975, another advocates tapping the brakes.  leadership from speaker nancy pelosi (d-calif.) could help resolve this fight. but she has been loath to exert it publicly.when the senate passed its energy bill in june, it raised cafe standards, which rest around 25 miles per gallon today, to an average of 35 mpg for all cars, light trucks and sport-utility vehicles by 2020. yet an initial attempt to address fuel economy in the house was scuttled by powerful energy committee chairman john d. dingell (d-mich.). he wants to address the issue in the climate change legislation he plans to introduce this fall. environmental advocates rightly worry that such a punt means a boost in cafe standards won't happen. but one must. the transportation sector accounts for a third of u.s. carbon dioxide emissions, a major contributor to global warming. even the national petroleum council,  charged by president bush to study the nation's energy sector, urged in a report released last week that the fuel economy of cars and light trucks be improved ""at the maximum rate possible.""the bill from rep. edward j. markey (d-mass.) has 150 sponsors and would go a long way toward achieving that.  it would require a boost in cafe standards for both cars and light trucks to an average of 35 mpg by 2018. but a rival bill from rep. baron p. hill (d-ind.) and rep. lee terry (r-neb.) that has 103 sponsors, including mr. dingell, would proceed more slowly by creating separate standards for cars and trucks and allowing the government to set a standard for cars of not less than an average of 32 miles per gallon but not more than 35 miles per gallon by 2022. in addition, the bill attempts to undermine california's tough new air pollution laws by getting the transportation department, which deals with fuel economy, into the business of regulating carbon emissions, which the supreme court ruled in the spring is within the purview of the environmental protection agency. an all-republican bill from rep. joe l. barton (r-tex.) and more than two dozen other sponsors seeks to slow things down even further by proposing a fuel efficiency average of 35 mpg for cars and 27.5 mpg for light trucks by 2022.ms. pelosi is already on record supporting higher cafe standards for cars and light trucks. considering that mr. markey is a close ally of ms. pelosi, it is not difficult to imagine her backing his  bill. but she has yet to commit to allowing it  --  or any other cafe legislation  --  to be offered as an amendment when the energy bill comes to the floor. it is vitally important that the house pass its own cafe legislation. to hope and pray that the senate version survives the conference process, during which mr. dingell will assuredly have a role, is a bad strategy. so is putting off action until mr. dingell's climate change legislation is introduced.  the momentum is there for strong cafe standards. a public nod from ms. pelosi could be all mr. markey needs to get his amendment the support it requires to pass.",House of Representatives

""this is a little bit of a zoo because of the numbers, but there's a lot of benefits. you get to watch them move, watch them run, see if they're really 6-3, 215 pounds.""there are lots of high school coaches who think the combines and training camps are a waste of effort. that's what i thought until saturday.the chance to be seen by so many influential college coaches and to compete against the best is too valuable to bypass.the players are tested in the early sessions while coaches stand in a roped-off area mostly talking with each other. others are paying attention to players running 40-yard sprints, throwing and jumping. pat ruel, usc's offensive line coach, has brought along binoculars so he can get an up-close view of the linemen.later, players take part in position drills, and the coaches are allowed to freely roam the field. the coaches want the players to know they are there. each one is wearing either a hat or shirt with an insignia identifying their school, and the players notice.kenny rowe, a highly recruited defensive end from long beach poly, is moving from drill to drill, but he's asked if he sees any particular schools represented. he starts rattling off, ""usc, ucla, mississippi, oregon, washington ...

""these guys have an opportunity of a lifetime. you get a chance to showcase what you can do.""but scholarships are more likely to be offered based on a performance at a specific college training camp during the summer than this one in may because there are too many players to evaluate and the coaches aren't working with the players individually.""all this doesn't mean anything unless you can put on the pads,"" linebacker jordan campbell of norco said. ""a guy can run a 4.4 40, but can he take a hit?""there are 12 nike training camps held throughout the country, and there is uncertainty whether coaches will be allowed to attend future camps. an ncaa rule adopted last month will ban coaches from attending combines that are devoted exclusively to testing for agility, speed and strength. what elements must be included in a training camp that would allow college coaches to attend is still be to interpreted, said erik price, an assistant commissioner for the pacific 10 conference.many camp participants already had scholarship offers but wanted to test themselves against other top prospects.chris forcier, a quarterback from san diego st. augustine, has committed to ucla. he said he was interested in trying to convince others that he's one of the best in the nation.most of the coaches already knew before the camp who they wanted to see, and it's a chance for them to confirm their initial impressions or discover something they didn't notice on video.there are risks involved for the athletes, such as letting everyone know they aren't as tall as listed on their high school roster. and those who might have been involved in other sports would have been wise to skip the camp because it's a grueling, competitive event for which you should train.""it's a necessary thing because you need some kind of standardized test to gauge an athlete,"" said james mitchell, the strength coach at harbor city narbonne, who escorted running back eveian grigsby to the camp. ""it's good because once you get ranked, it ups your credibility.""it helps to have consulted with someone who already went through the recruiting process, and that was the luxury for quarterback ben longshore of canyon country canyon. his brother, nate, a quarterback at california, drove 45 minutes from berkeley to support ben and give advice.""i'm the comic relief,"" nate said. ""i keep him relaxed. i think he has one of the best arms out here, and that's one of the most important things. i'm sure he'll excite some people. he can hum it. i told him to let it loose and show what his arm is all about. if you can be relaxed in a setting like this, the coaches will know you have a comfort level and confidence in your ability.""in the end, the coaches with their designer sunglasses and state- of-the-art cellphones couldn't have been happier.said san diego state assistant jonathan himebauch: ""i think nike is trying to help lower gas prices by getting everyone in one spot, so we have to get off the freeways.""",

1690306948,New York Times,2015-06-23,News,A,Budgets,A.17,843,De Blasio Is Poised to Add Officers,"mayor bill de blasio, in a sharp shift from his initial objections, is poised to hire nearly 1,300 additional officers for the new york police department, a surprising addition in a $78.5 billion budget deal announced by city leaders on monday night.increasing the size of the force had been a top priority of the city council speaker, melissa mark-viverito, and the notion was endorsed by mr. de blasio's police commissioner, william j. bratton. but the move has been opposed by some advocates for criminal justice reform, and it is expected to add at least $100 million to the city's budget.the mayor, who has pledged to improve police-community relations, has long been hesitant to hire more officers, saying he felt comfortable with the city's near-record-low level of crime. but his administration has come under intense pressure in recent weeks after a notable increase in homicides and shootings compared with the same period last year.""there have been long conversations particularly over the last few weeks on what was the right thing to do,"" mr. de blasio said on monday night at city hall, with ms. mark-viverito at his side. ""we came to a plan that allows us to strengthen our police force while encouraging a deepening of reform, while finding key reforms on the fiscal front.""the budget deal, which is expected to be approved by the full council this week, represents a roughly 4.7 percent increase from the one approved last year. on the police issue, aides to the mayor said the plan included new and hard-fought limits on overtime pay for officers, to blunt the impact of added wages and benefits. about 300 of the new officers would form a new counterterrorism team to patrol areas of the city perceived as high risk, like times square.and in what mr. de blasio billed as a ""pioneering"" step in police reform, the city is expected to debut a new neighborhood-based policing model, in which patrol officers would be given about one-third of their day away from radio calls to develop closer relationships with residents of their precincts.still, some council members were taken aback on monday that mr. de blasio went beyond the 1,000 new officers that ms. mark-viverito had requested. and reform advocates, who had celebrated mr. de blasio's criticism of aggressive policing, were upset.""this deal to increase the n.y.p.d. head count seems like politics at its worst,"" said monifa bandele, a leader of the advocacy group communities united for police reform. ""it's disappointing and perplexing that the city budget will increase the n.y.p.d. head count when systemic problems with police accountability and culture, that allow new yorkers to be abused and killed, have yet to be fixed.""the police department currently has about 34,600 uniformed personnel, a number that will grow by roughly 890 new officers who are to graduate from the police academy on july 2. the force was significantly expanded in the early 1990s, under former mayor david n. dinkins. since then, it has shrunk amid recessions and a sharp drop in urban crime.mr. bratton had allied himself with ms. mark-viverito's request for 1,000 new officers, one of the few points of open contention between the council speaker and the mayor, who are both democrats. the proposed increase in officers had, in turn, been an item of apparent discord between mr. de blasio and his police commissioner, whom the mayor has presented as a close partner.as recently as june 5, mr. de blasio told a radio caller that raising the head count was unnecessary, arguing that officers had already been freed up because his administration had reduced the number of police stops and arrests for possessing small amounts of marijuana.""when you have a force that's effective in the way the n.y.p.d. is now and getting better, i think that's a reason to stick with what we're doing,"" the mayor said during an interview on wnyc.another reason, according to some skeptics, is a fiscal one: the long-term liabilities for the city budget, which would have to add millions for retirement and pension costs. ""the problem is what happens when they've been there awhile and then, really acutely, when they start to retire,"" said nicole gelinas, a senior fellow at the manhattan institute, a right-leaning think tank.""we can only afford to add more cops now because wall street is booming and we're probably in the throes of another real estate bubble,"" ms. gelinas said. ""what happens when that goes away?""the budget deal for the fiscal year beginning in july also included encouraging news for advocates of the city's libraries. the city is to add $39 million in funds to extend library hours and keep many branches open six days a week. ms. mark-viverito also received funding for one of her signature initiatives, the creation of a $1.4 million bail fund that would help low-income defendants accused of low-level crimes.",Police Department-New York City NY

409032685,USA TODAY,2007-03-16,News,NEWS,Native North Americans,A.1,1654,A cloud looms over the Grand Canyon Skywalk ; Tribal leaders see a bridge to an economic future; opponents see a sacrilege,"grand canyon west, ariz. -- janette havatone gazes at the peach- colored, glass-bottomed viewing platform being nudged into position 4,000 feet above the grand canyon's floor on her native hualapai indian reservation and recalls how she wept when she first heard of plans to build the structure.""you got a natural peace when you were out here, and that's gone,"" says havatone, 51, a teacher turned gift shop clerk. but she's philosophical now about the tourist attraction. her tribe, she says, is ""moving from the natural into a new era.""tribal officials look at the new grand canyon skywalk that juts 65 feet off the rim into thin air and see economic survival. some conservationists, however, view it as a tacky tourist attraction that defaces a natural wonder.the much-hyped $30 million skywalk will give tourists with steely nerves and $74.95 to spare a bird's-eye view of the canyon below when it opens march 28. but already, skywalk has been dubbed everything from inspired to blasphemous.""i still believe in the old ways,"" havatone says. ""but this sets us up for the future. my children and grandchildren will have something to fall back on"" economically.on monday, three years after construction began on the million- pound platform, members of the impoverished hualapai tribe will walk out onto the horseshoe-shaped deck for the first time. former astronaut buzz aldrin leads a ceremonial ""first walk"" tuesday.the soaring walkway is certainly the hualapai's most out-there tourist endeavor, though it isn't their first. or their last.skywalk is the centerpiece of grand canyon west, the 9,000-acre swath of the 1 million-acre hualapai (wall-a-pie) reservation set aside for tourist development. plans call for a 6,000-square-foot visitors center at the entrance of the platform with a high-end restaurant, museum, movie theater and meeting space.a long-term $45 million airport expansion at grand canyon west to accommodate larger aircraft is underway. forty cabin-style rooms are planned, and some of them are open. off-road turf for hummer tours is being expanded. a resort hotel may eventually take shape. and perhaps most audaciously, the tribe is considering running a tram from the rim to the canyon floor.far from the national parkthe hualapai's location at the far western reaches of the 277- mile-long canyon and about 250 road miles west of the major tourist facilities at grand canyon national park's south rim means they attract only a fraction of the park's numbers.about 300,000 visitors a year arrive here (compared with the national park's more than 4 million), and most are on day trips from las vegas. tribal officials predict the skywalk will double attendance this year alone and say they can handle 2,000 visitors a day (up from an average of 500 on the rim), despite the lack of infrastructure such as electricity and water.for now, they're trucking in 8,000 gallons of water a day from 30 miles away. waste is hauled out. power is generated by diesel engines. and getting into the park requires a 14-mile drive over unpaved, washboard roads.not all the hualapai's previous ventures have had happy endings. a casino built in the mid-'90s folded after only seven months -- the first arizona indian gaming operation to do so. turns out, visitors, most of whom were fresh from the glitz of las vegas 120 miles west of here, had little desire to jerk slots handles in a gloomy airport terminal when the wondrous grand canyon loomed nearby.similarly, a proposed ""scientific disneyland"" featuring telescopes for night-sky viewing never got off the ground. in 1999, the tribe allowed daredevil robbie knievel to jump a side canyon on his motorcycle, a feat that garnered intense, though fleeting, attention.baby steps for tourismthe tribe's first foray into tourism came in the 1970s when it began offering rafting trips on the colorado river. today, about 6,000 people a year run the river. they arrive by vehicle on the only road into the canyon 18 miles downhill from the tribal headquarters at peach springs and are lifted out by helicopter.later, the tribe partnered with other operators to run combination sightseeing flights and pontoon boat rides. new in the past two years are a rimside indian village, featuring replica native dwellings of several tribes, and a faux old west town with cowboys, but notably, no indians.the grand canyon west experience is at once free-form and scripted. visitors who haven't flown in on a package deal park their vehicles near a sign warning of low-flying aircraft at the small airport terminal and take shuttle buses to the attractions.drivers make standard wisecracks about ""grand canyon divorces"" (""step back a little farther, honey ...""), and the same gunfight plays over and over in the dusty old west plaza. at the indian village, native american dancers in native dress -- though not necessarily that of their own tribes -- perform for tips.at eagle point near the skywalk, greeter don havatone, brother of janette havatone, is resplendent in a homemade feathered headdress. he guides visitors to the edge of the 4,000-foot abyss, which, unlike the glass-sided skywalk, is unfettered by guardrails.  he swears they haven't lost anyone yet.as a sovereign nation, the hualapai aren't bound by national park service regulations. this is the only spot in the grand canyon where helicopters can fly below the rim, for instance.there are no park rangers, though there is a security guard who threatened spectators with expulsion last week for snapping photos of tribal officials and business associates walking on the newly rolled-out skywalk.(the tribe is saving the photo opportunities for tuesday ceremonies with aldrin.)'tacky, gross, commercial'meanwhile, this latest attraction has sparked apoplexy among some environmentalists.though he understands the hualapai's need for economic development, ""the tribe has repeatedly brought tacky, gross commercial ventures into the canyon, and it's inappropriate. especially when there are alternatives,"" says kieran suckling, policy director for the tucson-based center for biological diversity.""we're frankly aghast at what they're doing to the grand canyon. it's one of the seven wonders of the world, and they're making it a disneyland.""some tribal elders also express concern. one octogenarian, who didn't want her name used for fear of retribution, says the skywalk violates long-held beliefs that the land should be respected.tribal leaders counter that they're developing only a fraction of that land. having opted out of gaming, a $23billion-a-year industry for native american tribes elsewhere, the hualapai looked for something to generate revenue and saw their slice of the grand canyon as a natural.""for us to take a small portion is nothing

1034336215,New York Times,2012-08-21,News,A,Stop & frisk,A.1,1233,"Majority in City See Police Dept. As Favoring Whites, a Poll Finds","a significant majority of new yorkers say the police department favors whites over blacks, according to a new poll by the new york times.that view, as widespread now as it was in 2001 during the administration of mayor rudolph w. giuliani, is particularly prevalent among black new yorkers, 80 percent of whom say the police favor one race over the other. a plurality of white residents -- 48 percent -- agree.concern about police favoritism comes at a time of intensified scrutiny of the department's extensive practice of stopping, questioning and, in many instances, frisking people on the city's streets. last year, the police made nearly 700,000 stops; about 85 percent of the stops involved blacks or hispanics.the poll found that a majority of black residents said the stop-and-frisk tactic had led to the harassment of innocent people, but most white residents viewed the practice as an acceptable way to improve urban safety.among all new yorkers, 48 percent said the tactic was ""acceptable to make new york city safer,"" while almost as many -- 45 percent -- deemed the tactic ""excessive."" most of those surveyed rejected mayor michael r. bloomberg's chief rationale for the practice, saying they did not think that stopping and frisking suspicious people had lowered the crime rate or reduced the use of illegal guns.""stop-and-frisk would be a good idea if they did it right,"" jose aponte, 64, a retired doorman who lives in the bronx, said in a follow-up interview after the poll. ""but it's not decreasing crime or guns. there are more shootings every day.""but mr. bloomberg and the police commissioner, raymond w. kelly, received high marks on the crime issue: 57 percent of new yorkers said they approved of the way the mayor was dealing with crime, and 61 percent said they approved of the way the commissioner was handling his job. even 50 percent of the respondents who said they had been the target of a racially motivated police stop approved of mr. kelly's management.""i live in brooklyn, in coney island, and everybody has guns; 3-year-old kids have guns! it's outrageous,"" said johnny rivera, 52, a former foreman at an aluminum company. as for the stop-and-frisk tactic, he said, ""the worst thing they could do is stop it.""mr. bloomberg, who has overseen a significant rise in the number of stops during his nearly 11 years in office, scored slightly lower on his stewardship of race relations, with half of residents saying they approved and one-third saying they disapproved. just 36 percent of black residents said they approved of the mayor's handling of race relations.james westcott, a bronx resident who has been unemployed for two years, said he had been stopped by the police on three occasions. ""one right after the other, by three different patrol cars,"" mr. westcott, who is black, said. he also said the police had become less considerate, adding, ""it started getting bad when giuliani was mayor, and now it's getting worse and worse.""""you know it's excessive when you see people get stopped who really don't deserve to be stopped, like kids going to school,"" mr. westcott, 44, said. ""the police just jump out, stop them, search them, take their names down, then get back in their car and leave, and the kids don't know what went on.""but some new yorkers, while conceding that the police show favoritism for one race over another, said the stop-and-frisk tactic's ends justified the means.""if that's what it takes, i find it acceptable,"" said jani kipness, 58, a special-education teacher from brooklyn who is white. she said that she thought that officers ""single out minority groups,"" but that ""if you look at the crime in new york, it's less white people; that's just the way it is.""""i wouldn't want to be stopped and frisked,"" she added. ""but if you look at cities like detroit and other cities that have a way higher crime rate than new york, i think new york has to be doing something right.""the stop-and-frisk practice has come under harsh criticism from civil liberties groups and some lower court judges. the issue has become a subject of debate among elected officials and has apparently captured the attention of the public: more than three-quarters of new yorkers interviewed for the poll said they had heard a lot or some about it.the criticism has prompted mr. kelly, who has argued strongly that the stop-and-frisk practice is an important crime-fighting tool, to pledge changes to ensure the lawfulness of the practice. the number of stops fell by more than 34 percent in april, may and june, compared with the previous quarter.crime is not new yorkers' top concern. but more residents cited crime and violence as an important problem than in a times poll two years ago. the proportion who would prefer to keep living in the city, rather than move away, is at the highest level in more than a decade.opinions about the stop-and-frisk practice are divided by race. fifty-five percent of whites described the use of the tactic as acceptable; 56 percent of blacks called it excessive. among hispanics, 48 percent said it was acceptable, and 44 percent said it was excessive. republicans, independents and queens residents generally support the practice; democrats and manhattanites generally deem it excessive.over all, 64 percent of new yorkers said the police favored one race over the other, a steep rise from the early years of the bloomberg administration, when less than half of residents agreed with that sentiment. the last times poll in which the perception of police favoritism was as widespread was taken in 2001, the final year of mayor giuliani's tenure, when race relations were noticeably more tense. (the question has not been asked in a times poll since 2003.)these views, in many cases, appear to have been influenced by personal experience. a third of the new yorkers surveyed, including 37 percent of black people, said police officers had used insulting language toward them. a fifth of the respondents said they had been stopped by a police officer because of their race or ethnicity, and almost all were black or hispanic, and more likely to be young and male.""in the bronx, brooklyn, queens, they will stop and frisk blacks and hispanics more,"" said kevon geanus, 20, a construction worker who is black and lives in the bronx. ""the way they talk to you, and curse at you, when you're just walking, for example, and say: 'why are you walking? what are you doing out here at night?' ""the poll of 1,026 adults, conducted aug. 10 to 15 using landline phones and cellphones, has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points. the margin is six points for black respondents and seven points for hispanic respondents.a street mural in east new york, brooklyn, depicts police officers using the stop-and-frisk tactic, which has been heavily criticized.

""we hold the event each weekend after the lunar new year day,"" yeung said.according to the chinese zodiac, each new year is ruled by one of 12 animals -- rat, tiger, rabbit, dragon, snake, dog, horse, sheep, rooster, pig, monkey and ox. this year is ruled by the rabbit. for the vietnamese community, celebrating tet, it's the year of the cat.at the corner of college street and broadway, a parking lot was converted into a food court with a staging area. there, the air was mixed with the scent of barbecue smoke and fireworks. dance groups and singers performed on stage while people sat at tables eating egg rolls, plates of barbecue and pad thai.""everyone brings in their own culture here,"" said may chiang, the entertainment organizer. the tiny district, she said, also has populations from vietnam, taiwan and other areas of southeast asia.nearby, citlalli cuevas, 27, wandered along the white tents with her 6-year-old daughter, jimena, who was dressed up as a white rabbit. cuevas said she moved to los angeles from mexico more than a year ago because of her husband's new job. she learned about saturday's event through the internet and her daughter's school.""i thought it would be fun to bring her here,"" cuevas said, looking down at her daughter.

432653848,New York Times,2004-01-22,News,F,Interior design,F.1,1588,"From Paris Castoffs, A Recherche Retreat","''everything has been rescued in one form or another,'' said catherine levy, referring to the toy trunk she uses as a bench in her apartment here, her mismatched dining room chairs, the white enamel counter in her kitchen. almost everything in her 860-square-foot apartment, not far from the bastille, is meant to amuse. ms. levy is one half of tse & tse, a design partnership created in 1991 when she and sigolene prebois joined forces. playful interpretations of everyday objects (their row of test tubes known as the april vase; their light garlands of tiny bulbs dressed in colorful bows or paper cubes) have made tse & tse a hot name on the french contemporary design scene.they are not to be confused, however, with the french designer augustine tse and his tse fashion label; nor should they be confused with the fly that causes sleeping sickness, although that's what inspired the name. ''we wanted a name that could be separated into two parts,'' ms. levy said, by way of explanation.whether people understand the name or not, the company's wares are showing up all over the globe. their lighting and housewares are a sensation in japan. tse & tse's exploding circle of fairy lights, which sold for around $90 at habitat in london, was singled out as a fabulous holiday decoration by four british newspapers.inside modern living in toronto sells the tse & tse floor-to-ceiling totem pole carved birchwood storage unit. ''think of it as a tree with branches that hold vases, lamps, wire picture holders or metal shelves,'' said daniel aguacil, the store's owner, who is a fan of their work. in new york their housewares are at clio, karkula (the former breukelen) and at conran's.ms. levy's home, which she shares with her boyfriend, christophe prebois, a photographer and her business partner's brother, looks onto a quiet street a few blocks behind the bastille opera, a derelict neighborhood until a decade ago when it was pioneered by bobos -- france, too, has its bourgeois bohemians.the apartment shares the tse & tse aesthetic, where familiar items have been inventively repurposed. sitting at a table that was once a long wooden counter used in a textile shop for unrolling lengths of fabric, ms. levy explained how she found the chairs for the table -- several different shapes and sizes, now painted in bright colors -- on the street or at cheap flea markets as far a way as prague.''i don't believe i have ever bought a new piece of anything,'' she said, pointing out a metal file cabinet used as shelving, wooden crates that form a coffee table and pieces of hand-printed fabric from her sister's textile company, maison georgette, that she has hung to create a wardrobe in the bedroom.''i find it an amusing exercise to make use of what one has or comes across, to never succumb to a conforama or brico depot,'' she said, referring to the french equivalent of the home depot or lowe's. ''i've managed to carry the most impossible things onto airplanes,'' she said, including an entire standing closet that she carried back, in pieces, from japan. she found it at the salvation army in tokyo for $53.''shipping it would have cost a fortune,'' she said. ''it was either get it on the plane or leave it in the street.''ms. levy, 39, also collects fabrics when traveling -- mostly to india (where tse & tse produces some of its products) and japan. she brings the fabrics back to a tailor here who transforms them into the basic clothing she likes: long skirt, shirts that wrap or tie, shawls.ms. levy's clothing is like an album of her business trips. and she keeps extensive notebooks to catalog what she saw but could not bring back. in fact, tse & tse used a collage of pages from ms. levy's notebook to design a fabric print for the japanese fashion designer issey miyake.''everything we've designed has come out of a desire for pleasure,'' ms. levy said. ''we try to always amuse ourselves.'' she and ms. prebois made their porcelain and glass tableware (which includes dishes, carafes, bowls, goblets and cups in curvaceous, slightly asymmetrical forms) because they themselves needed plates.''we really liked them and so did our friends, so they became a tse & tse product,'' ms. levy said, adding as if it were unthinkable, ''we certainly didn't just sit down and say, 'let's make tableware.' ''ms. levy and ms. prebois were still students at the newly created ecole nationale superieure de creation industrielle when they began collaborating. the school was founded as an experiment, with no set curriculum, in 1983 by jacques lang, then the minister of culture. many successful french designers now in their 30's and 40's are products of the school, including jean-marie massaud, matali crasset and patrick jouin.''it was considered very experimental at the time,'' said francoise jollant kneebone, who was director of the school from 1998 to 2001. ''there was a lot of media coverage.''while still at school ms. levy and ms. prebois created a rubber jewelry collection that became a mini sensation in paris. ''we were cute and young, so the press loved us,'' said ms. levy, who grew up in the preppy 16th arrondissement here and remembers standing out from the other children. (for one thing, she wore coats her progressive mother brought back from afghanistan.)pierre romanet, director of the sentou galleries in paris began selling tse & tse products 10 years ago. he refers to the two as designers ''who are also artists -- which gives them that extra plus.''the much lamented store shi was the first in new york to discover the tse & tse aesthetic. ''when shi stopped selling them, she passed them on to me,'' said john erik, the owner of karkula, as if tse & tse was a precious resource not to be squandered. ''they create things that look superprecious, but they are very affordable.'' a case in point, he said, is their ink bowls. ''beautiful, food-safe bowls, a set of five, made of paper and covered in the natural resin of an african tree,'' he said. ''they look like wet black ink. a set of five is $125.''many tse & tse products have become contemporary classics of parisian homes. one is the glass flower vase hanging from the ceiling in a teardrop form (tse & tse designed the original, which has been much copied); another is its tiny igloo of porcelain for burning votive candles, and yet another, its porcelain fruit bowl with silver or gold interior or exterior. once considered the kiddies of the french design scene, the women are now so mainstream that they have designed for habitat and baccarat.ms. levy's style for furnishing her apartment reflects a poetic eye and a playful design aesthetic. her sofa from morocco is made of braided reeds, and she uses the wooden toy trunk from her childhood as a bench. a charles eames rocking chair was acquired for its light-hearted design. she liked the shape of a watchmaker's bench (curved to prevent delicate pieces from falling) and turned it into a shelf. her kitchen counter, which has a white enamel top, once stood in a medical laboratory.ms. levy stores her bed linens on a shelf above her bed in a row of nylon bags from southern india. the shelf was made from wood decorated with arabic lettering found in the street. and just below the ceiling in the living room are strings of lights in various sizes and shapes collected from europe and asia, including, of course, india.this fall, the french publisher seuil will bring out a book called ''cent % indian,'' devoted to ms. levy's collection of utilitarian indian objects. these playful light bulbs, radios and kitchen utensils were created under laws, since lifted, that promoted home-grown indian industries.and when those brightly colored lights around the ceiling burn out, what will she do? ''find something else that amuses me,'' she said.finding tse & tse''i love their work -- so well designed and so much fun,'' said michelle lehmann, an owner of clio in new york, which carries tse & tse vases, plates, hungry serving forks (below; platinum tips $76; all porcelain, $59), trays, votives and the tse & tse mirza teapot ($108; left). ''it's the most interestingly designed teapot i've ever seen,'' ms. lehmann said. ''it's art.'' clio, 92 thompson street (spring); (212) 966-8991.john erik, who owns karkula, carries tse & tse bowls, porcelain dishware and lamps. the set of five ink bowls costs $125.

""instead of talking about a workforce crisis, we are taking action.""the summer program, aimed at promoting collaboration between designers and builders, was the first major training  at the new center. the two sessions drew 84 participants, who were exposed to a variety of masonry crafts, including brick, stone, plaster, tile, restoration and terrazzo. as part of a team-building exercise, the young architects and masons participated in designing a community school and building elements of it.the international masonry institute provides training for all levels of craft workers in masonry, as well as programs for building designers and contractors. the training is free to union members.with the new campus, the institute will be able to expand its program offerings and provide a ""living classroom"" to field-test new products, officials said. the campus also will be the new home of the summer camp.as part of events celebrating the official opening, the institute on sept. 21 will host the international apprentice contest, which is expected to draw 100 apprentices in the various trades to the bowie campus for a competition that will include written and building exercises.",

right to provide financial support for his son, despite hurley's opposition.1. donald brenchairman, irvine co. // 74, newport beachsimply put, orange county looks like orange county--much of it uniformly manicured and catering to the high life and high tech-- because of the influence of one man. uc irvine, fashion island, the irvine spectrum, university research park, newport coast, orange county's thousands of acres of wilderness and parkland and its enviable public school systems all bear bren's imprint. so does the new majority, a growing coalition of wealthy, socially moderate republicans who helped vault gov. arnold schwarzenegger, an old skiing buddy of bren, into office. he's the richest man in orange county--worth an estimated $7.5 billion, according to the o.c. business journal--and has been snapping up property in century city, san diego and the silicon valley as well. he is publicity-shy and enigmatic but don't let his style fool you: bren's involvement can mean life or death for a voter initiative, political campaign or philanthropic cause. his priorities are education, conservation (penance for a guy who has paved over a good chunk of the county?) and continuing to lift the o.c. out of l.a.'s long, but ever- shortening, shadow.2. eli broadcivic leader // 73, brentwoodit's one thing to be rich. it's another to use your money--in broad's case, $5.6 billion, according to the l.a. business journal-- to insert yourself into virtually every major decision affecting the civic life of a city. broad's zeal for a renaissance in downtown l.a. saved disney hall when lagging donations threatened to turn it into an expensive underground garage. he has given us a serious high school for the arts while shaping the museum of contemporary art, the los angeles county museum of art and the grand avenue project. he's also expressed an interest in buying the times. broad has heaped a fortune on caltech, ucla, pitzer and usc, which this year received $25 million to create a stem-cell research institute named for him. his foundation trains public school superintendents, he recruited roy romer to head the los angeles unified school district and he now supports mayoral control of lausd--so strongly that he recently spanked mayor antonio villaraigosa for ceding too much power to the teachers unions. before all this, broad made his mark in other ways: his homebuilding company, kaufman & broad, sowed greater l.a. with middle-class ranch houses--what some would call the region's signature sprawl.3. barbara e. kerrpresident, california teachers assn. // 59, riversideit's not clear if kerr has ever gotten her first-grade class in riverside to listen. but she sure has the attention of the mayor and governor. no issue is more critical to the future of the region than education, and nobody wields more influence in this arena than does kerr, president of the 335,000-member union. with united teachers los angeles president a.j. duffy stepping back and letting her do most of the talking, kerr engineered the deal in june with villaraigosa that would, among other things, strip power from the lausd board and give individual teachers much more sway over classroom instruction. critics say the mayor caved in to the unions, but it's no surprise that kerr has villaraigosa's ear. under her direction, the cta helped defeat villaraigosa's opponent, incumbent james hahn, with a tv attack ad in 2005. the lausd deal must next pass muster in sacramento, where kerr knows how to mix it up. just look what she did to gov. schwarzenegger last year after he reneged on an education-funding agreement. kerr and her troops went to war, helping defeat a slate of special election ballot measures that schwarzenegger was pushing. who's the terminator now?4. antonio villaraigosalos angeles mayor // 53, windsor squaremuch of his power is derived simply from his position as head of the region's biggest city. but it's far more than that. with seemingly boundless energy, villaraigosa is bent on putting his stamp on all of the local hot-button issues of the day--crime, transportation and education--in a way that his predecessors never managed. he has forged close ties with the city council, winning easy passage of his first budget and an increase in trash collection fees to pay for more cops. although he is l.a.'s first latino mayor in more than 130 years--making him an important symbol locally and nationally--villaraigosa has worked hard to embrace different communities throughout the city. his detractors say he is perpetually in campaign mode and can be weak on policy details. and he has taken plenty of lumps on the lausd deal. but villaraigosa still has the benefit of the doubt from all the players who really count, be they in the union halls; the legislature, where he once called the shots as assembly speaker; or the governor's office.5. roger mahonyarchbishop, archdiocese of l.a. // 70, los angeleswith 5 million roman catholics in l.a., ventura and santa barbara counties, mahony boasts a huge flock, especially in the latino community. some say the church's sex abuse scandal has undermined his influence, but there's another way to look at it: mahony's ability to keep secret the files of priests suspected of misconduct underscores just how powerful he is. (the church was compelled in april to turn over internal documents to a los angeles county grand jury, but mahony is still resisting in civil cases.) all the while, he remains a force in the immigration debate. the we are america coalition used pleas from mahony to help turn out hundreds of thousands of protesters in may. mahony has also helped change the face of downtown with the $200-million cathedral of our lady of the angels--a concrete and alabaster edifice that wags have dubbed the ""taj mahony"" and ""rog mahal.""6. philip anschutzindustrialist // 66, denversouthern california has more than its share of absentee landlords. few, however, have had as much impact as anschutz, who forbes says is now worth $6.4 billion. the tycoon made his first fortune in oil and gas and built a 130-mile pipeline from kern county to wilmington. he owns staples center, the home depot center in carson, the kings hockey team, the galaxy soccer franchise and (with ed roski) nearly 30% of the lakers. staples has been an anchor in the revitalization of downtown los angeles, and anschutz's entertainment company aeg--operating through l.a.-based lieutenant tim leiweke--plans to spend more than $1 billion to construct an adjacent hotel and commercial development that promises to inject even more life into the area. anschutz is also a mover in hollywood, with a controlling interest in movie theater chain regal entertainment and an eye for producing films geared toward children and families. he's had his misses--""around the world in 80 days"" was a box-office dud--but ""the chronicles of narnia"" served as a $1- billion lesson to the rest of the industry on the profitability of family entertainment.7. henry samuelicofounder, broadcom corp. // 51, corona del marsamueli isn't your typical orange county mogul. sure, he owns the anaheim ducks hockey franchise and the company that manages the arrowhead pond. but before his net worth swelled to $2.4 billion (according to forbes), this son of holocaust survivors ran a liquor store. samueli became a professor of electrical engineering at ucla, and today is the named inventor on 36 u.s. patents; besides serving as chairman of chip maker broadcom, he remains its chief technical officer. the youngest member of the top 10 list, samueli is a rising star in regional affairs, where he has given more than $160 million mostly to educational and healthcare institutions. two engineering schools are named after him (at ucla and uc irvine), and a center for alternative medicine at uci is named for his wife, susan. samueli may become even more of a household name if he realizes his next dream: bringing an nba franchise to anaheim.8. jerry bruckheimertv and film producer // 61, l.a. and bloomfield, ky.nobody in hollywood has more clout these days than this master of screens big and small. his new release, ""pirates of the caribbean: dead man's chest,"" has shattered box-office records. each one of bruckheimer's movies is a mega-operation, supporting hundreds of local jobs (even when filming occurs elsewhere), and a substantial part of the next chapter in the ""pirates"" trilogy is slated to be shot in an old aircraft hangar in palmdale, a big lift for regional film production. but in some respects, it's in tv where bruckheimer is making the deepest impression. he is the producer of eight prime- time series now on the air--two shy of the record he set last season. these include his ""csi"" franchise, ""without a trace,"" ""cold case"" and his hit reality series ""the amazing race."" as much as anything, it was bruckheimer's move into prime-time television in 2000 that helped lift the stigma of working in the genre and signaled the start of l.a.'s shift from tinseltown to tv town. with that has come a boom in tv shoots--and many thousands of jobs for actors, writers, craftspeople and more.9. david gelbaumconservationist // 57, newport beachyou may never have heard of him and, at just 5-foot-5 with a slight build and soft-spoken demeanor, gelbaum may not seem particularly powerful. but by donating more to conservation causes than anyone in the state--anonymously--this hedge-fund multimillionaire has taken a leading role in safeguarding something near and dear to the hearts of many here: the outdoors. under the guidance of politically savvy environmentalist david myers, gelbaum's gifts have protected enough mountain and desert land to create another yosemite national park, and his donations to wilderness education programs have sent nearly half a million inner- city schoolchildren to the mountains, desert or beach, many for the first time. crucial tracts of the mojave national preserve have been protected, thanks to the wildlands conservancy, which gelbaum cofounded. these days, the conservancy finds itself in the thick of the debate over the development of tejon ranch in the teha-chapi mountains. the gelbaum-backed group, along with the sierra club and others, wants to reduce the amount of the ranch that will be paved and preserve 245,000 acres as wilderness-- a tussle that will help define the limits of growth in southern california.10. haim sabanmedia mogul // 61, beverly hillswe'll be honest: saban wouldn't have cracked the top 10 a few months ago. but his recent involvement in a deal to buy l.a.-based univision communications, by far the nation's largest spanish- language broadcaster, catapulted him to the fore. though saban doesn't have nearly as much money in the $13.7-billion purchase as do the private-equity firms with which he's partnered, it will be largely up to him to figure out where the company goes from here--a vision that will ultimately be reflected in millions of tv sets throughout southern california. that's because saban (who speaks five languages, including spanish) is the one with an extensive background in entertainment and media, having built his wealth (estimated at $3.1 billion by the los angeles business journal) on mighty morphin power rangers cartoons and the sale of fox family worldwide. saban's civic involvement has run more to national and international issues than local ones. however, he gave $40 million to childrens hospital los angeles, where wife cheryl serves on the board, and he has been a major supporter of the motion picture & television fund, which helps provide for those in the business who are in need.the next 90n. christian anderson iiipublisher and ceo, orange county register; 56, coto de cazait's tough to admit it, but anderson, a virtual lifer at orange county's leading newspaper, first as editor and then as publisher, waged a block-by-block newspaper war with the l.a. times on its home front until tribune co. bought the times and all but waved the white flag. it's impossible to ""out-local the locals,"" anderson said then. in proving his point, he has solidified o.c.'s separate identity in southern california.lee bacal.a. county sheriff; 64, san marinohis 8,000 deputies protect 2.7 million people and guard america's biggest jail system. turnover is high, homicides are up and 150,000 inmates have been released early over the last four years amid crowded conditions that a federal judge called ""not consistent with basic human values."" yet baca--so quirky that he is known within law enforcement circles as ""sheriff moonbeam""--just won a third term with ease.dean baqueteditor, l.a. times; 49, santa monicayeah, we know what some will say: how self-serving to put your boss on the list. but baquet, who won a pulitzer prize in chicago and served as the new york times' national editor before coming to l.a. in 2000, sets the agenda for the most powerful media voice in the region. with resources shrinking, how well baquet weathers budget pressures from long-distance owner tribune co. will go a long way toward determining how robust that voice remains.steve barrfounder, small schools alliance;47, silver lakethrough his green dot charter high schools, he's been a serious pain for the l.a. school district, luring away top teachers, organizing a parents union, launching five charter schools near jefferson high after the district rebuffed his takeover offer, testifying in sacramento and, along with california charter schools assn. head caprice young, generally ratcheting up the debate over the future of public education.stephen l. bingreal estate heir, 41; los angelesbing is perhaps best known for getting socked by actress-model elizabeth hurley with a successful paternity suit. but he is the playboy with a bit of policy wonk in him. last year he spent $4 million to deep-six proposition 77, the redistricting initiative. now the big democratic donor is bankrolling a measure to help fund alternative energy. bing also invests heavily in film projects and gives lots of dough anonymously to local causes, including education and the environment. recently spotted dining at jar with villaraigosa.bishop charles e. blakepastor, west angeles church of god in christ; 66, beverly hillswith the rev. cecil l. ""chip"" murray retired from first ame church in south l.a., blake has become the man to see when courting favor in the city's african american community. with 24,000 members, his congregation is among the largest in southern california. villaraigosa--who is close with blake's son-in-law, fallen labor leader martin ludlow--sat up front at a recent service, and the democratic gubernatorial candidates came by to pump blake's hand.william j. brattonl.a. police chief; 58, los felizhe's more than a law-and-order man; he's a celebrity, and with that comes the power of celebrity. as recent events show, bratton is tough enough to take on the city council--and savvy enough to know when to kiss and make up. politicians seek his endorsement, and other chiefs across the country look to his example. most importantly, he's been quite effective, restoring a measure of order and dignity to the long-suffering (and, some would add, insufferable) lapd.harry ""skip"" brittenhamentertainment attorney;64, santa monicaoperating largely under the radar, the highly trusted and intensely competitive brittenham represents more top studio executives than any other hollywood lawyer, while also counting among his clients some of the town's biggest a-list stars--tom hanks included--and major corporations. indeed, brittenham has factored into virtually every huge deal in hollywood over the last two decades, including the sales of dreamworks skg to viacom and pixar animation studios to disney.james brultegovernment affairs consultant;50, fontanaas the former gop leader of both state houses before he was termed- out of the legislature, brulte has deep connections that run clear to the white house. he hangs his hat these days at california strategies, a top political consulting firm. brulte was the founding member of the budding inland empire chapter of the new majority, and has filed to run for the state board of equalization in four years. meanwhile, gov. schwarzenegger has enlisted him to frame debates with phil angelides, and on the other side of the aisle, he delivered crucial support for villaraigosa's election.ron burkleinvestor; managing partner,yucaipa cos.; 53, beverly hillsthe billionaire, who just missed our top 10 list, maintains close relationships with politicians of all stripes (from villaraigosa to former gov. pete wilson) and is said to give generously (and anonymously) to local causes. a big friend of labor, the onetime supermarket magnate dispenses advice to the united food and commercial workers. he has been involved with trying to bring an nfl team to l.a., and he's signaled interest in buying the times.jerry bussowner, l.a. lakers and l.a. sparks,73, playa vistasome fans will never forgive him for letting relations between his two top players fester and ultimately casting his lot with kobe over shaq (who just picked up another championship ring in miami). but the fact remains: in spite of the clippers' rise, the lakers remain the no. 1 show in a sports-obsessed town. its games are the place to be seen by hollywood royalty and myriad other power brokers, and buss is the man who has engineered the spectacle for more than 25 years, bringing eight championships to town.rick carusodeveloper; 47, brentwooda kitsch-meister? perhaps. but the developer of the grove, the outdoor mall adjacent to the l.a. farmers market; the americana at brand near the glendale galleria; and other retail-entertainment projects has altered the shopping landscape and transformed neighborhoods. the former head of the l.a. police commission can play tough too: when opponents tried to stop him in glendale, he beat back a ballot initiative and then sued his rivals.dov charneyfounder and ceo, american apparel;37, los angeleshe's gotten into some hot water for creating a sexually charged atmosphere at his company, but this outspoken advocate for immigrant rights has made his mark in a more profound way as well: he has shown that you can compensate your workers decently and still compete in the local garment business. charney's downtown l.a. factory is the largest single apparel plant in the nation, employing 3,800 workers, the vast majority of whom are latino. he pays an average of $12.50 an hour, and many of his workers purchase cheap, company-subsidized health insurance and enjoy other perks.siu-man chiul.a. county health specialist;50, temple citychiu has dispensed letter grades at hundreds of chinese restaurants in the san gabriel valley. there's no way to be sure if she and her colleagues reduced hospitalizations for food-borne illness--13% countywide, according to one study--but we feel better about our kung pao knowing that chiu has been on the case.sean collinssurf forecaster; 54, seal beachthose empty cubicles all around you mean one thing: surf's up. an early developer of the online surf check, collins' website (www.surfline.com) pulls in 1.5 million visitors a month. some boarders grouse that collins has made the beach intolerably crowded, but his unmatched ability to accurately predict the size and destination of rideable waves ensures that no ""sick"" day ever goes to waste. and so, thanks to him, at least the workplace is a lot more mellow.warren m. christophersenior partner, o'melveny& myers; former u.s. secretaryof state; 81, beverly hillsone of a handful of octogenarians on the list, christopher has slowed some of late. but behind the scenes, he continues to advise local leaders on a variety of matters, including effective governance. the man who investigated the causes of the watts riots in the '60s and headed the commission that reformed the lapd after the rodney king beating is now looking into whether to scrap or extend l.a.'s term limits for public office.robert addison daybusinessman; philanthropist;62, bel-airthe grandson of superior oil co. founder william m. keck and founder in his own right of trust co. of the west, day oversees the w.m. keck foundation, a $1.3-billion nonprofit that has underwritten, among other things, the keck school of medicine at usc, the keck graduate institute at claremont colleges and health and medical facilities in east l.a. the billionaire--who also sits on the boards of the broad foundation and claremont mckenna college- -is a major, albeit low-key, philanthropic influence.james dotipresident, chapman university;59, villa parkdoti has transformed a quiet private college in orange county into an influential university with seven- and eight-figure gifts pouring in. political insider paul folino sits on the board of trustees. financier lawrence dodge and his wife, kristina, kicked in $20 million for the new film school. doti has doubled physical growth on campus since 1991, when he took over, and tripled academic space. on top of all that, the phd economist helps produce a financial forecast that's well respected by the business community.peter m. douglasexecutive director, california coastal commission; 64, larkspurdouglas doesn't get a vote on the commission, but he is no mere bureaucrat. as the panel's senior staffer for more than 20 years, he has as much--if not more--influence over coastal communities and beachfront access as any of its 12 members. after the commission beat back hollywood mogul david geffen's effort to keep the public off the beach near his malibu home, douglas didn't mince words: ""with all of the lobbying power and legal power he could afford to buy, in the end, the public's rights prevailed.""dr. michael v. drakechancellor, uc irvine; 55, irvinecall him dr. fix-it. arriving just as uci was being nailed for hospital and medical school-related scandals--yet again--drake launched investigations into problems with the transplant program, beefed up oversight of the medical school and medical center, and demoted the hospital's chief executive. the result: uci's lackluster relationship with the rest of orange county is already improving, with fundraising now at record levels.maria elena durazoexecutive secretary-treasurer, l.a. county federation of labor // 53, el serenobecause she was elected in march, it's too soon to know just how effective durazo will be in running the region's largest labor group, an organization that counts under its umbrella 350-plus unions representing more than 800,000 workers. doubters say durazo-- the widow of the federation's late leader, miguel contreras--will never match her husband's immense clout. but she has a lot going for her, including a longtime friendship with mayor villaraigosa. the big question is whether the woman who showed herself to be a firebrand while leading the hotel workers union (her husband called her ""agitational"") can in her new role build bridges to business, government and other unions.joe edmistonexecutive director, santa monica mountains conservancy;57, pacific palisadeshis critics mutter that he has built an empire that is off- limits to everything except his ego and his lust for more land. but the conservancy now controls more than 62,000 acres of once-private turf between east ventura county and the whittier narrows largely because of edmiston's political and financial savvy. among his recent trophies: the 2,900-acre ahmanson ranch.douglas r. failingdirector, caltrans district 7 // 48, arcadiafailing oversees a stretch of 1,188 miles of freeway in l.a. and ventura counties on which drivers log the daily equivalent of 4,000 trips around the globe. of course, sometimes it feels like 8,000. but failing is trying hard to move in the right direction. under his leadership, caltrans is set to build the first high-occupancy- vehicle lane on i-5 in l.a. county, has added 21 miles of carpool lanes on the 405, has installed electronic signs with estimated travel times, has launched the 101-405 interchange improvement project and has taken numerous other steps to try to ease gridlock.paul folinoceo, emulex corp.; 61, coto de cazaa onetime backer of an after-school programs initiative started by then-actor schwarzenegger, folino now heads the founding chapter of the new majority, a group of wealthy republicans organized in early 2000. a key fundraiser for the governor, he has elevated the organization from an ""insurgency of misled millionaires,"" as one gop hard-liner once grumbled, to a broadly inclusive, center-right juggernaut with 150 members in o.c., 85 in l.a. county and new chapters in the inland empire and san diego county.david geffenlongtime record producer; cofounder, dreamworks skg; 63, malibugeffen is another enormous name who barely fell out of our top 10 list. the ucla school of medicine--where geffen pledged $200 million, the most ever to a u.s. medical school--bears his name. so does the geffen playhouse, geffen contemporary and other local institutions. he also has given significant sums to aids organizations, including at a time when the topic made other philanthropists a little queasy. downtown power brokers grouse that he doesn't do quite enough civically these days. but that could all change if he steps in to buy the l.a. times.frank gehryarchitect; 77, santa monicathe west coast's reigning star architect languished in l.a. for years. but he started to roll in the early 1990s, and since its completion in 2003, disney hall has made gehry a symbol of l.a.'s creative life. he's now working on the grand avenue project, intended to give downtown l.a. a residential-commercial heart. in five years, it'll be easy to look back and see how many local buildings, from low-slung westside homes to downtown skyscrapers, are his.jim gilchristanti-illegal immigration activist;57, aliso viejoa retired accountant, this cofounder of the minuteman project and his volunteers began patrolling the arizona-mexico border last year with private planes and night-vision goggles. the unsuccessful congressional candidate has put fresh heat on a perennial hot button, fomenting debate--and division--from national political circles to hometown parades in places such as laguna beach and pacific palisades.kevin goetzmanaging director; executive vice president, otx; 44, studio citygot a blockbuster in the pipeline? chances are that goetz will have something to say about how it gets released. the hottest market research company in hollywood is otx, where goetz and his team provide studios with tracking information about audience interest in upcoming films. a former child actor who has appeared in many commercials--he was the domino's pizza boy for a couple of years-- goetz personally tests about five movies a week and has a hand in about half the flicks that leave hollywood.stanley p. goldceo, shamrock capital advisors; chairman, usc board of trustees;64, beverly hillsgold may be best known for joining with his associate, roy disney, to lead a shareholder revolt against walt disney co. and then-ceo michael eisner in 2004. but gold's local influence has long reached beyond hollywood. shamrock, the disney family's investment company, manages a $150-million fund that puts money into low- to moderate-income neighborhoods around l.a. it also owns industrial and commercial properties in koreatown, carson and other parts of the southland. gold himself has made millions in gifts to usc, where he has chaired the board since 2002.nick haquerestaurateur; 40, hollywooda certain clout comes with being the owner of the hottest restaurant in l.a., and as the owner of koi, haque hasn't been shy about exploiting it. celebrities are thick on the ground at his establishments, which include bridge, and haque's anti-paparazzi system is said to be one of the most elaborate and hardest to crack in the city. nonetheless, rumor has it that at least one celebrity magazine has spent thousands of dollars on meals at koi just so gossip columnists could sit in the dining room and report on star sightings.antonia hernandezpresident and ceo, california community foundation; 58, pasadenathe foundation--which boasts assets of $800 million and shepherds tens of millions of dollars in donations to local nonprofits each year--is one of the most vital philanthropic organizations in l.a. county. since taking charge of the group in 2004, hernandez has pushed it in new directions, focusing on quality-of-life issues for the elderly and at-risk youth while steering away from job training and other areas where it has been harder to show gains. before coming to the foundation, hernandez for 18 years headed the mexican american legal defense and educational fund.robert hertzbergattorney; 52, sherman oaksthe former california assembly speaker is one of the few local politicians with credibility and solid connections on both the left and the right, as evidenced by hertzberg's working relationships with villaraigosa and schwarzenegger. although hertzberg lost his bid for mayor of los angeles, he remains a discreet advisor on civic issues such as economic development, transportation and term limits, and he's an important champion for the san fernando valley.alan hornpresident, warner bros.; environmentalist; 63, bel-airwarner bros. has had a disappointing summer at the box office with ""poseidon"" and ""lady in the water,"" but horn gets high marks across hollywood for being a class act and a solid guy. he makes our list, though, for another reason: in between green-lighting movies, horn has shown himself to be green in another way, enlisting a bevy of entertainment executives to back the national resources defense council. now it's arguably the state's leading environmental organization and, with rob reiner (a former partner of horn at castle rock entertainment) and laurie david in its corner, one of the hottest causes on the west coast.deirdre 'deedie' hudnutadmissions director, the center forearly education // 58, beverly hillsit could just be a myth that los angeles' most sought-after elementary school(and a favorite among the elite of the entertainment industry) is step one on the southern california fast track to the ivy league. still, up to 1,000 applicants a year vie for about 60 slots there. hudnut shares the task of picking, but she's the one who does the bulk of the interviewing. incidentally, her husband is headmaster at harvard-westlake, the private high school that's step two, or so they say.john husingprincipal, economics & politics inc.; 65, redlandshusing provides economic analysis and counsel to every major city in the inland empire, as well as to both riverside and san bernardino counties and two community colleges. he has also been key (along with southern california leadership council co-chair bob wolf) in positioning the area as a logistics and transportation hub. in his private life, husing has trekked in the himalayas, but the biggest mountain he has climbed is convincing people that the inland empire--long regarded as a backwater--is now a potent economic force.robert igerceo, walt disney co.; 55, brentwoodlong gone are the days when one entertainment chief--namely, mca's lew wasserman--was so powerful that his presence transcended all of hollywood. today, top executives pretty much keep their heads down. but walt disney co. is simply too big a fish--or should that be mouse?--to ignore with 30,000 employees in l.a. and orange counties. iger, of course, is at the helm of it all, having been named ceo following the tumultuous reign of michael eisner. iger has quickly stepped out of eisner's shadow, acquiring pixar animation studios, continuing to shake up the disney board and taking steps to move the company forward through the application of new technologies.frank jaochairman and ceo, bridgecreek group // 57, huntington beachjao got his start in the 1970s with a strip of vacant industrial buildings that he turned into a shopping center serving his fellow vietnamese exiles. since then, the man known as the ""godfather of little saigon"" has owned or developed roughly three-quarters of orange county's best-known ethnic commercial enclave and remains the community's biggest landlord. some 1,500 business tenants lease space in the half a dozen developments he owns there, and his holdings keep expanding. his latest ventures include the district's first major residential project. also, coastline community college has opened a little saigon-area campus, thanks in part to his largesse.earvin ""magic"" johnsonurban developer; 46, beverly hillspeople believe in magic to the point that his mere involvement gives cautious corporate investors the confidence to venture into inner-city neighborhoods. his magic johnson theatres (a partnership with loews cineplex entertainment) are lighting up the crenshaw district more than a decade after the 1992 riots. his real estate fund (another partnership, with canyon capital realty advisors) has underwritten redevelopment in hollywood and downtown l.a. his deal with starbucks--he's its sole outside partner--has brought jobs (and $3 lattes) to more than three dozen low-income neighborhoods in southern california. his political endorsement is among l.a.'s most influential, and talk persists of his mayoral potential.lucile m. jonesseismologist, u.s. geological survey; 51, la canada-flintridgetechnically, jones is a specialist in earthquake probabilities, but for 20 years she's been the ""earthquake mom,"" calming the public after a temblor with her reassurance and expertise. she's also an outspoken member of the state's seismic safety commission. when schwarzenegger's administration tried to fire jones earlier this year (on the centennial of the san francisco quake, no less) the reverberations were so strong that the governor overruled the removal the same day.steve ""jonesy"" jonesindie rock deejay; former sex pistol; 50, benedict canyonhis playlist on kdld/kdle-fm (103.1) is pretty much whatever the bloke feels like 'earing, which has made ""jonesy's jukebox"" not just one of l.a.'s hottest radio shows but the source of a cottage industry in downloads and cd sales. virgin megastores now feature ""jonesy's picks"" sections. at least three fledgling bands have gotten major label deals because jonesy played them. and though the station doesn't match the ratings or signal strength of l.a.'s alt- rock big dog kroq-fm (106.7), it's credited with forcing rivals to get edgier or step aside.bruce karatzchairman, kb home; 60, bel-airin the homebuilding industry, karatz is known as a master marketer. he has spent two decades helming the former kaufman & broad home corp., the company that virtually created suburban southern california. his concept in 1996 of ""pre-selling"" homes before they're built--a revolutionary idea at the time--is now common. but beyond that, karatz is a major civic presence, serving over the years on many important local boards (from usc to rand corp.) and wading into democratic politics (though he backed the wrong horse--bob hertzberg--for mayor).jeffrey katzenbergceo, dreamworks animation;cofounder, dreamworks skg;55, beverly hillskatzenberg not only leads the chief competitor to disney in the animation arena, but he has evolved into an important civic presence. a major fundraiser for aids service and treatment organizations, katzenberg also chairs the motion picture and television fund, which underwrites home healthcare and housing for the needy who have worked in the entertainment industry.geraldine knatzexecutive director, port of l.a.; 54, long beachknatz came to the port of l.a. this year from the neighboring port of long beach, giving her a thorough understanding of the nation's biggest harbor complex. together, the ports generate some 500,000 jobs, dwarfing other major industries here. but until knatz made her move, l.a. and long beach behaved like bitter rivals, creating a chronic obstacle to air-quality improvement. now, with knatz reaching out to her old boss, port of long beach executive director richard steinke, the two appear destined to work together on pollution reduction and more. ""she gets up at 4:45 in the morning and kicks butt all day,"" one admirer has said.john kobylt and ken chiampoutalk-radio hosts; 45 and 50, beverly hills and hermosa beach, respectivelyok, ok. we know these are two names (technically making our list the west 101). but there is no way to separate john and ken, the guys behind l.a.'s top-rated afternoon-drive talk show on kfi-am (640). whether you agree with them or not, the impact of their angry- white-guy campaigns is unmistakable. when villaraigosa declared that the nation relies on immigrant workers, saying, ""we clean your toilets,"" john and ken fans deluged city hall with more than 1,000 toilet brushes. their daily rants against gov. gray davis (gumby, they called him) were instrumental in the 2003 gubernatorial recall, as was their support of schwarzenegger, which has--uh-oh--been wavering.robin kramerchief of staff to mayor villaraigosa; 53, windsor squarepress-shy but preternaturally plugged in, kramer has been the right hand of so many downtown heavy-hitters that even she may have lost count. she was chief of staff to former l.a. councilman richard alatorre, then chief of staff to mayor richard riordan, then senior director of eli broad's foundation and now--after intensive lobbying by antonio himself--chief of staff for villaraigosa. her fingerprints are, by the nature of her job, invisible, but her name brings instant credibility to any boss or cause.tim leiwekepresident, aeg; 49, brentwoodas phil anschutz's l.a. lieutenant, leiweke handles dealings with the kings, the galaxy, home depot center and staples center, among other matters. but he is powerful enough to call his own shots too. lately he has shifted his attention overseas and ceded some local duties to others in his organization, but he's still the point man here, with unmatched influence over the sports and entertainment experience in l.a. and the future of the figueroa corridor.randall lewisreal estate developer; 55, claremontmuch of the inland empire looks the way it does because of the lewis family's homebuilding company. besides constructing houses, it also underwrote parks and theaters that still dot cities such as pomona and rancho cucamonga. randall's parents eventually sold their business, yet the lewis name remains dominant in inland empire real estate, with four sons specializing in master-planned communities and commercial projects. randall has emerged as the company's public presence, and other developers view him as a big thinker. among other things, he cofounded an influential educational alliance with arrowhead credit union president larry sharp (another inland empire power broker) and is promoting a set of locally based public health initiatives.mark lisantieditor, defamer.com // 32, silver lakewith 8.5 million page views a month, lisanti has proved how scary an irreverent guy blogging in his underwear can be. he--and the legion of celebutainment gossips mimicking his mouthy online persona- -have shortened the news cycle from 12 hours to 15 minutes and irreversibly changed the tenor and power structure of hollywood coverage as old media has chugged to catch up. sure, the couch tom cruise jumped on belonged to oprah. but it was lisanti's cellphone- snapped photomontage of the episode and hilarious commentary that ricocheted wildly online until they wound up going mainstream, ensuring the star's rapid public-opinion plummet.richard lovettpresident, creative artists agency;46, brentwoodunder lovett, bryan lourd and five other partners, caa has earned a rep as the microsoft of talent agencies, snapping up rivals and scooping up clients so that making a movie without them is now next to impossible. they've also branched into sports managment, signing slugger derek jeter and quarterback peyton manning. caa has also snagged xbox wizard seamus blackley to guide it in the burgeoning market for video-game deals--an area that has become an l.a. power center in its own right (especially since industry giant electronic arts opened a giant playa vista games studio in 2003).william lyonchairman and ceo, william lyon homes inc.; 83, coto de cazafor decades, lyon has been one of the first calls politicians make when they need support in orange county, and it's not because he's a soft touch. a major o.c. homebuilder, new majority member and chairman of team california, the state gop's pro-arnold fundraising campaign, lyon is inordinately influential, both within his party and his industry. lyon also gives time and money to a range of causes, including the orangewood children's foundation and the orange county center for the performing arts.hadi makarechianchairman, capital pacific holdings; 58, newport beachever wonder why so many orange county republican fundraisers happen to take place at the st. regis monarch beach resort and spa in dana point? hint: the hotel's developers are local gop heavyweights, hadi makarechian and his son, paul. the elder makarechian made a fortune in construction on the east coast, retired in 1990 to california, then made another fortune building coastal mcmansions. a board member of orange county's new majority, he has donated prodigiously to schwarzenegger and his various initiatives. meanwhile, paul, a fledgling commercial developer, has helped launch gennext, a new majority spinoff for younger gop members.alfred e. mannbiotech entrepreneur; 80, beverly hillshis biotech ventures--11 at last count--have involved pacemakers, insulin pumps and much more. the alfred e. mann institute is an incubator for biomedical research. (usc was granted the $100- million-plus gift after the billionaire got fed up with the red tape at ucla, his alma mater.) but perhaps just as important, the 167- acre mann biomedical park, which houses several of his start-ups, spawned a biotech cluster that has perked up valencia.richard meruelodeveloper; 41, whittiermeruelo is said to be the largest private landowner in downtown l.a., controlling more than 100 properties with millions of square feet. but what made political types really take notice was the $197,300 he spent last year--more than any individual--to help elect villaraigosa. now he's making headlines for his aggressive real estate tactics. among them: battling architecture school sci-arc out of a downtown property it wanted and getting barred for five years from developing a parcel near union station as punishment for demolishing structures on it without a permit.michael milkeninvestor, philanthropist; 60, encinoyes, there will probably always be that boilerplate: ""disgraced former junk bond king."" but milken has been tireless in his other life as a philanthropist. he and his family have donated more than $750 million--a fifth of it locally--over the last three decades. and he doesn't just give; he takes on causes, with education high on the list. additionally, his underwriting of research into life- threatening diseases (cancer runs in his family) has meant new treatments for leukemia and breast cancer at ucla. to top it off, his milken institute is a leader in analyzing the local economy.arturo ""arte"" morenoowner of the angels; 60, phoenixmoreno's first act upon taking over the angels in 2003 was to endear himself to fans: he cut ticket and beer prices. later, he forced anaheim to let him wedge some other nearby city into its home team's name. orange county-ites and dodgers devotees in l.a. protested, but moreno hung tough and his strategy is paying off. sports junkies from all over southern california feel increasingly free to root for the angels. moreno has also moved into spanish- language radio, the team has signed a lucrative broadcast rights contract, and forbes recently estimated that the team is now worth about twice what moreno paid.david murdockchairman, dole food co. andcastle & cooke; 83, hidden valleythe billionaire has been a big local political donor and a philanthropic pioneer. when he built a $4.5-million communal housing complex for the mentally ill near camarillo last year, the state's mental health director praised him for having ""set the model for the state."" now, the health-conscious murdock (he's a self-professed ""fish vegetarian"" and has pushed dole heavily into nutrition research) is off on a new venture: he has brought in a ucla scientist and insurer wellpoint inc. to help create the must-have reservation for well-off southland boomers. scheduled to open in november in westlake village, the california wellbeing institute four seasons portends an evolving niche: luxury healthcare.brian murphychairman, southern california music for live nation; 58, studio citythere are more important tastemakers in the concert world--paul tollett's annual coachella music and arts festival, for one. but murphy's company, spun off in december by clear channel entertainment, recently acquired its largest competitor, house of blues concerts, and thereby strengthened its dominance in deciding what we hear.sam nazarianceo, sbe entertainment group; 31, beverly hillswith his father's real estate business as a leg up and club impresario brent bolthouse as a partner, nazarian has taken control of most of the velvet ropes in l.a. the newly remodeled privilege; the soon-to-reopen area; the celebrity petting zoo of the moment, hyde; the swank supper club lobby--they all are nazarian's. at the reopening of privilege in july, the crowd spilled onto sunset boulevard like fans at a hollywood premiere. next up: a chain of japanese restaurants, katsuya, the first of which just opened in brentwood.dominic ngchairman, east west bank; 47, pasadenang has taken ethnic banking mainstream. at east west, founded in chinatown in 1973 and now the second-largest commercial bank based in southern california, the staff greets customers in spanish and vietnamese as well as cantonese, mandarin and english. the company's stock price has tripled this decade. meanwhile, ng raised record funds for the united way of greater los angeles by bringing in new donors, solidifying his leadership in philanthropy as well as finance.henry t. ""nick"" nicholas iiiinvestor; philanthropist; cofounder, broadcom corp.; 46, newport coastthough best known for his gigantic ego, intense work style and high-profile marital problems, there's no doubting the import of nicholas' influence. with broadcom cofounder samueli, he helped give orange county a new high-tech gloss. and as a local philanthropist, he's heaped millions on the arts and a range of education and technology projects. the billionaire has also donated vast sums to law-and-order causes, his interest stemming from his sister's murder 23 years ago. nicholas is credited, in particular, with fending off an overhaul of the state's three-strikes law.bart o'brienplant guru // 50, uplandin 16 years as a senior horticulturalist at rancho santa ana botanic garden in claremont, the harvard-educated o'brien has achieved a cult following for his ideas on redefining beauty in the garden. out with chinese gardenias, in with california lilac. no one has done more to bring the glory of our native flora to the attention of nurseries, landscapers and gardeners. drive down any street in southern california and where lawn gives way to penstemons, monkeyflowers and poppies, an o'brien convert can be found.ronald l. olsonpartner, munger, tolles & olson;65, pasadenahis clients have ranged from the filipino government to warren buffett, but at home in l.a., he's one of the most sought-after power lawyers around. olson played a key role in minimizing damage to southern california edison during the energy crisis of 2001, and defended mike ovitz and his severance package against walt disney co. shareholders. he represented merrill lynch in the orange county bankruptcy and brad grey when his name came up in the anthony pellicano investigation. recently, the getty trust called on him amid its scandal.alexandra patsavasmusic supervisor // 38, pasadenaone snippet of a song playing in the background while, say, seth pines for summer on ""the oc"" and--boom--an indie rock star is born. patsavas, who picks songs for the hit show (as well as for ""grey's anatomy,"" ""without a trace"" and ""rescue me"") has become one of the most powerful gatekeepers in the entertainment business. each week she is deluged with cds from record labels, band managers and artists.anthony pellicanoprivate detective; 62, u.s. metropolitan detention center, los angeleshe's behind bars, where clout tends to be hard to come by. but information, as they say, is power, and pellicano--alleged wiretapper to the stars for more than a decade--has amassed reams of it in his long service to the city's most high-profile entertainment figures and their lawyers. in fact, one reason this list is short on l.a. attorneys is that so many have seen their power eroded because of the probe into pellicano, who--so far at least--claims not to have talked to the authorities.a. jerrold perenchiooutgoing chairman, univision communications inc.; 75, beverly hills""zelig-like"" was the way a recent times profile described perenchio's involvement in entertainment, politics and sports in the region (and nationally). he built univision into the nation's dominant spanish-language broadcaster, and recently sold out to an investment group that includes haim saban. his personal take is estimated at about $1.3 billion, leaving him poised to increase his philanthropic power. by some estimates, perenchio--malibu's largest landowner--has already given away many millions to disney hall, ucla and others. the ronald reagan ucla medical center, it is said, probably wouldn't be getting built without him. but quantifying his contributions isn't easy because perenchio's preference is to remain far under the radar.curt pringleanaheim mayor; 47, anaheimpringle has taken some heat for having lost anaheim's name- change fight with the angels and for struggling to muster consensus on courting the nfl. still, pringle is not only running unopposed, he's also been endorsed by his biggest critic. it's a testament to the skill and war chest of the ambitious gop leader of disneyland's hometown. more broadly, pringle has built such a strong reputation for his aggressive pro-business approach to governance (creative tax waivers, sweeping zone changes, market incentives to redevelop run- down parts of the city) that other local officials have coined a verb for his philosophy: ""to pringle-ize.""david pyottchairman and ceo, allergan inc.;52, san juan capistranohe's the man who took botox mainstream. it has been more than 15 years since allergan bought the rights to an obscure little treatment for eye spasms. when pyott became ceo in 1998, few outside the hollywood underground knew that botox could also smooth wrinkles. pyott ramped up spending on research and development, got the fda to approve botox for cosmetic uses and has marketed it so aggressively that it's all but a way of life in looks-conscious southern california. allergan's next possible blockbuster: juvederm, a dermal filler that reduces the appearance of lines and folds.connie ricelawyer; 50, altadenaan l.a. civil rights attorney (and the second cousin of secretary of state condi), she has weighed in on transportation, race relations and dysfunction within the lausd, among other things. most recently she chaired the blue ribbon rampart review panel, charged with providing a final accounting of the notorious police corruption scandal. as is rice's style, the report throws down a gauntlet, calling for an expansion of the lapd and an end to the culture of ""warrior police.""ramona ripstonexecutive director, aclu of southern california; 79, marina del reypolice abuse, jail crowding, reproductive rights, school desegregation, gay rights, crosses on l.a. county's seal--name a civil liberties fight, large or small, and ripston has fought it. of late, she has found herself defending plans to honor salam al- marayati, executive director of the muslim public affairs council. also recently, she was named by her old friend villaraigosa to l.a.'s commission on homelessness.fraser rossfounder, kitson boutique;

(he even has an investment in sunset photo and news.) ross also has a kids' store, an internet business, a soon-to-open men's store and a coming shoe line.edward ruschaartist; 69, venicewith surprisingly resonant images of otherwise banal subjects such as standard gas stations, a norms restaurant, the hollywood sign, parking lots and the sunset strip, ruscha has personified ""l.a. artist"" since the mid-1950s. perennially popular, he has gained increasing respect in the last decade, and in 2005 represented the united states at the venice biennale. this year, the l.a. county museum of art purchased 156 works from ruscha in an effort to acquire a complete set of his prints, while the museum of contemporary art elected him to its board of trustees.esa-pekka salonencomposer; conductor and music director, l.a. philharmonic; 48, los angelesthe dashing finn was a rising star when he arrived here 14 years ago. since then, he has matured into one of the world's most impressive conductors and composers, while turning the l.a. phil into the hippest, hottest cultural ticket in town. thanks to the orchestra's with-it image, the classical music audiences in disney hall are now urban, edgy, diverse--nothing like the dowdy crowds of yore.steven b. samplepresident, usc; 65, san marinoonce usc was branded the university of spoiled children. no longer. under sample's leadership, usc has become a magnet for foreign students, with nobel laureates on the faculty, average sat scores that rival ucla's and influential institutions such as the annenberg school for communication and the marshall school of business. sample is also a force on l.a. civic issues, reaching out to help develop the low-income neighborhoods around the campus.arnold schwarzeneggercalifornia governor; actor;59, brentwoodit's good to be the governator. good for southern kollyfornia too. though schwarzenegger is, of course, in charge of the entire state, his ties here create a special ripple effect. his bond initiative to buttress the state's infrastructure would, if it passes, have a disproportionate local impact. many of his closest advisors hail from the southland. and schwarzenegger's election has dramatically raised the profile of his republican backers in orange county's new majority.henry segerstromdeveloper; 83, newport beachthe patriarch of one of orange county's leading farm families, segerstrom famously turned a tract of bean fields into south coast plaza. the rest, as they say, is history. segerstrom has also been the major force behind the o.c. performing arts center, which will expand into a new hall in september--named, naturally, for the man and his family.muzammil siddiqireligious director, islamic societyof orange county; 62, fountain valleysiddiqi, whose mosque is among the largest in north america, is the religious leader of thousands of southern california muslims at a time when xenophobia is running high. after sept. 11, the white house invited him to preside over interfaith services at the national cathedral. since then, he has been a leader in driving home the point that muslims in the u.s. are peace-loving.nancy silvertonchef; restaurateur; 52, hancock parka big percentage of the current generation of l.a.'s chefs came from silverton's kitchen at campanile (which she founded with her ex- husband mark peel, who now pilots the place solo). with her weekly sandwich nights there, antipasto nights at la terza and mozzarella nights at jar, she's changed the way angelenos eat. she was the first baker to give all of l.a. access to artisan bread (at her la brea bakery, sold in 2001 for $56 million). and the restaurant she's about to open with mario batali, mozza, is the most highly anticipated in years.emily simonitschsenior vp, house of blues concerts; 53, glendalesimonitsch has helped bring latin music into the mainstream of cultural life in l.a. through her work at universal citywalk's gibson amphitheatre. when she started there in the '80s, julio iglesias was the only latin act who had played the venue;

35, los angeleswhen congress threatened to crack down on undocumented immigrants, sotelo--l.a.'s top-ranked morning deejay--gave organizers of a proposed pro-immigrant rally four hours on his program on ksca-fm (101.9). sotelo then worked with kbue-fm (105.5) host ricardo ""el mandril"" sanchez and others to pump up the volume. urging protesters to carry american flags and to be peaceful, the deejays summoned half a million or more to l.a.'s streets.steven spielbergmovie director; cofounder dreamworks skg; 59, pacific palisadesbeyond moviemaking, spielberg is perhaps best known as a worldwide force in jewish philanthropy. but his local impact is significant too. he has established a repository of 52,000 testimonies of holocaust survivors at usc, as well as given to the film school there. he has also been an active donor to the cedars- sinai medical center. the virtual megaphone attached to his fame, though, is his chief source of influence, and most any cause he champions (think driving a prius to the oscars) can become an instant trend, first in show business circles and then beyond.kevin starrhistory professor, usc; state librarian emeritus; author; 65, san franciscostarr's influence may ultimately last longer than anybody's on this list, because he is helping us to interpret what it means to be southern californians. some have criticized starr for being too boosterish. but his ""americans and the california dream"" series of books--now standing at six volumes, with nearly 10,000 pages--is dazzling in its breadth and depth of knowledge.marc sternfinancial executive; 62, malibustern has been the quintessential l.a. insider for decades, having served as the right hand to eli broad and robert day. he also has been a caltech trustee--long a position held by the real lions of los angeles--and an influential force in the arts world as chairman of the los angeles opera and a director of the performing arts center of l.a. county.caroline styneco-owner and wine director, aoc and lucques; 39, hancock parkchef suzanne goin's rustic-yet-refined cooking aesthetic is reason enough to frequent lucques and aoc, but it's styne's impressive range of wines by the glass that has shaken up the local restaurant world. before styne, l.a.'s wine scene was all about cult cabs and chardonnay. but she has inspired sommeliers at restaurants citywide to dare angelenos into becoming more adventurous drinkers and spawned a burgeoning wine-bar movement.trader joe's tasting panel, monroviawe cannot name them. we cannot show their faces. otherwise, trader joe would have to kill us, and that would mean no more chili lime peanuts and two-buck chuck for us. what we can say is that there are more than 10 of them and fewer than 40, and they're easily the most powerful group of food critics in southern california. the monrovia-based grocery chain has more weirdly addictive foods--and a more cult-like fan base--than probably any supermarket nationally. the reason is its expert tasting panel, which meets daily in secret to determine down to the last package of mandarin orange chicken what will go on the shelves of trader joe's groceries, which now number 256 in 20 states, including 82 stores regionally.peter ueberrothmanaging director, contrarian group inc.;

""he wasn't going to play the way he played in game 3. we were banking on that. he was in an aggressive mind-set from the start and he came up big.""the hornets hadn't won in dallas over 14 tries since january 1998. this victory means they might not have to come back until next season. they can eliminate the mavericks by winning game 5 tuesday night in new orleans.dirk nowitzki had 22 points and 13 rebounds and jason terry scored 20 points, but they didn't get much help. josh howard made only three of 16 shots, and jason kidd had three points, three assists and four rebounds before getting ejected with 7:16 left for a flagrant foul on jannero pargo. a fan was also ejected in owner mark cuban's row.coach avery johnson's mavericks went from scoring 30 points in the first quarter to 40 in the entire second half.""i don't really have an answer for it,"" said nowitzki, exhaling loudly and running his hand through his hair in frustration.

433388794,New York Times,2006-08-06,Commentary,3,Investment banking,3.3,1266,"My Country, Right and Wrong (but Why So Wrong?)","like many people, i am attracted to puzzles. i don't do crossword puzzles, and i no longer read many mysteries, but i am impressed at the number of conundrums there are in this world.one of the ones that continues to baffle me is the criticism of oil companies in congress and in the mainstream media, because oil companies have been very profitable. no one has been able to prove price-fixing. the federal trade commission specifically studied the subject, and found neither price-fixing nor gouging by any major oil company.i agree the profits are very large in absolute numbers, but in relative terms they are nothing like investment bank profits. why do we not raise an eyebrow when hedge funds make huge profits by moving around pieces of paper and roiling markets -- creating no social good i can see -- but raise a ruckus when oil companies make profits while keeping the whole nation going?i see the hand of an archaic envy here, and it's a dangerous hand.a second puzzle, and this is a killer: ''supply side'' economists say that by lowering taxes, we create more prosperity and more tax revenue because we stimulate economic activity. one way, supposedly, is that people work harder -- that is, more hours a week. with taxes cut, we keep more of what we earn, so we'll work more.(of course, you could also say that if we keep more of what we earn, we won't need to work as much, so we'll work less. but no one pays much attention to that, so we won't either for right now.)and, in fact, if you think about it, how else could income tax cuts stimulate economic activity except by encouraging americans to work more or else by having more americans in the labor force?yet, the number of hours americans work per week has barely budged in the five years since president bush's tax cuts, and is very much less than the number of hours worked per week on average in 1959, when tax rates were far, far higher than they are now.moreover, the percentage of male americans in the labor force has fallen by 10 full percentage points from 1959 to now. overall labor force participation has barely changed since 1989 -- almost entirely because of very large growth in the female labor force -- and has moved almost not at all since the bush tax cuts were passed.if the personal income tax cuts are not working to stimulate the economy through added labor, then just how are they working -- or are they working?a puzzle: we have all heard corporate executives say that american workers are paid too much; that our industries cannot compete with foreign makers because our labor costs are so high that if we used american union labor, we would see profits evaporate.and yet, hourly wages in this country, adjusted for inflation, are below what they were in 1972 (when my pal, richard nixon, was president) by a substantial amount. but to hear corporate leaders tell it, this is still far too high to allow competition with foreign entities.now, you would think that if this high-priced american labor were in fact pressing corporate backs to the wall, profits would be stagnant or falling. but in fact, in the last several years -- and especially the last few quarters -- corporate profits as a percentage of sales were the highest they have been since 1965 -- roughly 9.6 percent before tax and roughly 7.4 percent after tax.in total, profits are by far the highest they have ever been, running at a rate of very roughly $1.38 trillion in the first quarter of 2006. as a percentage of gross domestic product, profits are also the highest they have been since the statistics began being kept in 1959 -- roughly 12.7 percent.don't get me wrong. i like profits, a lot. they are what the capitalist society is all about. but why are we outsourcing, why are we moving our work overseas, if our corporations are so profitable? and if our corporate world is so profitable, how come so little of the growth goes to workers' wages? how come -- as an average number -- basically none of the growth goes to the ordinary worker's wages? i am not saying this to encourage strikes. i am genuinely puzzled about it.could it be that just the threat of moving jobs overseas (very few have in fact actually been moved as yet) keeps labor cowed? is the vast labor force of asia and the third world in fact something like ''the reserve army of the unemployed'' that karl marx described in his critique of capitalism?i hate and detest marx and everything he stands for, but he was a shrewd observer. in any event, what's going on? how can retail stores keep wages so low? all service jobs that have to be done in person are not going to be shipped to guangdong or mumbai. then why don't their wages rise?next mystery: in a nation with stupendous deficits even at the peak of the business cycle, with forecast deficits of nuclear-disaster status, how can it be important to repeal the estate tax? isn't there enough income and wealth inequality in america? don't we need the revenue? how on earth can any social good come from making taxes on the rich even lower than they are? how does this bind the nation together in time of war?don't get me wrong about this one, either. my father died in 1999. my sister paid a stunning tax on his estate and i would have preferred to keep the money. but my father was intensely grateful to this country for the opportunities it had afforded him. so are my sister and i. we don't see any unfairness in paying back to the government that pays the soldiers and marines and pilots and sailors who defend us and allowed our little family to move to the suburbs. (actually my sister lives in brooklyn, but that's another story.)why should the very rich not pay their fair share of the burdens of government? i could see a different argument if we were not hundreds of billions in the red, but in the real world, how can repeal or a drastic cut in the estate tax make social, moral or fiscal policy sense?here's my final puzzle: in a world that is clearly going down the tubes, where the forces of barbarism are on the march and the forces of civilization cannot stop them, why don't we all spend a large part of every day being grateful we are where we are?this country, with all of its problems, with all of its inequality and puzzles, is a verdant, lovely garden compared with the shrieking lunacy in so much of the world outside it. let's appreciate it enough to keep it.every question and criticism i make is within the context of a deep pride and thankfulness for being in america. i wake up in america the way i wake up in my own skin, to paraphrase my new hero, philip roth, and it's an old skin, but it's mine and i love it.drawing (drawing by philip anderson)",

""these students have free speech rights.""the fraternity organizer, pascal de maria, now a senior, said he did not believe anti-semitism was involved.chapman spokeswoman mary platt said the letter was under review and that some student contentions were untrue, such as being prohibited from wearing fraternity t-shirts.""they've been wearing those shirts all semester. there has been no action taken. that's ridiculous,"" she said. ""the university's only aim throughout all this is to assure that this group, as with any group, does not call itself an officially sanctioned chapman organization when it's not, because . . . it leaves the university with considerable liability.""the controversy's roots are more than 2 years old, when de maria and some friends decided to create a campus chapter of sigma alpha mu, a historically jewish fraternity. the students began recruiting members and meeting with university officials in spring 2005 about the application process. in april 2006, the university allowed a fraternity to set up on campus but turned down several, including sigma alpha mu.at the same time, the group's national organization gave the students ""colony"" status, a step below chapter status, and the chapman students began wearing t-shirts emblazoned with the greek letters on campus.in september 2006, joseph kertes and administrator chris hutchinson sent de maria a letter ordering him to stop advertising fraternity events on campus and forbade him to hold fraternity events on campus or meeting at chapman before heading to off-campus events.they also said the group must clearly indicate that it is not affiliated with chapman and request that the national organization send a letter to university officials stating that there is no chapter at the campus, and to agree to carry insurance coverage for chapman students who associate with the local fraternity.the letter was sent to several administrators, as well as the leaders of the university's sanctioned fraternities and sororities.chapman also sent leaders of these groups letters urging them to report to university officials if de maria or the other sigma alpha mu members were seen congregating on campus or wearing their t- shirts, villagra said.""i felt like a prisoner at the school i go to,"" de maria said.platt said she could not comment on the september 2006 letter because it would violate de maria's privacy rights.the university's decision to distribute the letter to other students is the subject of a complaint de maria filed with the federal government.she said the group was offered the option of becoming a school club, which is a much simpler process than becoming a fraternity.the only difference is that the group would have to admit any man or woman who applied, she said.the aclu letter does not question the university's decision to deny the group its imprimatur but seeks a retraction of the restrictions in the september 2006 letter, as well as expunging students' records of anything relating to the fraternity issue.villagra said that the restrictions were applied only to sigma alpha mu and not to any other unauthorized group that claims a chapman affiliation, such as the assn. of intellegentpot smokers and the under age drinkers (cu chapter), both of which assert school affiliation on their facebook pages.platt said university officials lacked the resources to police the internet.villagra said if the university failed to act, the aclu would consider suing.de maria said he would be happy if his group could do what other fraternal groups do -- play ultimate frisbee on the quad and hold meetings, charity benefits and social events.""we have no intention of making the university angry or provoking them,"" he said.""we really just wanted to associate ourselves with a brotherhood.""",

""no letups!"" he yelled underneath the stands in the arena corridor. ""no letups! we got a whole 'nother half.""this whole father-son nostalgia the university has been selling for almost two years had been more hope than reality entering yesterday afternoon, with more excitement coming from recruiting commitments than on-court results. but if john thompson iii has not yet completely refurbished the program his father willed into a national powerhouse, he got much closer in two of the most scintillating hours of basketball georgetown has ever played at mci center.as good as georgetown's future looked, yesterday felt like old- home week. oblivious to what had happened to his alma mater yesterday, dikembe mutombo got off a plane in detroit, where his houston rockets will face the pistons today.""georgetown beat duke?"" mutombo said in that rich, baritone cookie monster voice of his.""you mean men or women?""""no?"" deek said.""wow, they now have some very good players.""very smart, too.it is not often that duke is taught how to play by another team. yet georgetown tutored the blue devils for more than a half, spreading the court, drawing many of college basketball's best on- the-ball defenders to the perimeter before beating them to the goal. jeff green, georgetown's sophomore forward, completely outplayed duke senior all-american shelden williams, who finished with four points in 34 minutes.duke was defensively delirious, caught napping as the hoyas ran backdoor cut after backdoor cut. there was a reason it looked like princeton vs. ucla, circa 1996, when the defending national champs were stunned by a bunch of overachieving ivy leaguers cutting hard to the basket and making the most of every offensive possession in the first round of the ncaa tournament; thompson iii transplanted the princeton offense to his father's old campus.yesterday, the hoyas were a bunch of overachieving, smart big easters. they went to the floor. they withstood 41 points from the indefatigable j.j. redick.redick hit some absolutely unbelievable layups, using the hoyas as traffic cones on his way toward the rim. he made six three- pointers. but he was all duke had yesterday.""bowman, owens and green, those were all big-time players,"" mike krzyzewski said afterward. when was the last time the most accomplished coach in the college game said that about georgetown ballplayers?he also made an important distinction: ""it wasn't their offense as much as the unity of their offense,"" coach k said.essentially, five playing as one knocked off six mcdonald's all- americans.this win was a much more notable feat than the 1985 win, because the hoyas were no. 2 when they beat chris mullin and walter berry's st. john's team. these hoyas came in unranked. they had lost to every ranked team they had played. in fact, duke was more responsible for filling the building than was georgetown.but this was an afternoon when the hoyas' past and present fused together, and it felt right. on several t-shirts, sandwiched between the words ""some have forgotten"" and ""we will remind them"" was an unusually large roman numeral iii.before tip-off, big john was told his son's team would win if they played the perfect game.""they have to play better than perfect,"" he said.afterward, he smiled.

1771998110,Washington Post The,2016-03-11,Commentary,EDITORIAL - OPINION,Politics,A.15,775,Making America even worse,"good countries can sometimes go bad. donald trump's supporters implicitly make this argument when they proclaim, ""make america great again."" and so do those who loathe trump and see in him a dangerous populist response to the anger of frustrated middle-class voters.the rise of trump, love him or hate him, conveys an inescapable message: the united states' political institutions are in decay, and voters are angry at a government that they perceive (correctly) to be broken. the danger is that trump's responses would probably make the underlying governance problems worse - and increase polarization and dysfunction even more.the evidence of ""trump rage"" has been clear in nearly every primary and poll this year. ron fournier of the atlantic summed up the basic message when he quoted a voter in flint, mich., about the catastrophic failure of that city's water system: ""what matters to me as an american, what should matter to all americans, is that we learn from this: how do we change the way government works? how do we fix these systems?""here's the puzzle: a country that is angry at ""government"" or ""washington"" will have difficulty fixing problems that result from the breakdown of public services caused by underfunding, incompetence and the predominance of private ""special"" interests over the public interest. what's needed isn't less government, but better government - which costs money and requires good leadership.america's political dysfunction is the subject of an important book called ""political order and political decay,"" published in 2014 by francis fukuyama, a stanford university social theorist. fukuyama became famous for asserting the triumph of liberal social order in his 1989 post-cold war essay, ""the end of history?"" he has been trying ever since to sort out why that forecast proved so premature.fukuyama notes long-ago examples of thriving systems that grew rigid and failed to adapt to change, from the han dynasty in china to the mamluks in egypt to the old regime in france. he warns: ""modern liberal democracies are no less subject to political decay than other types of regimes."" theorists imagine that democracies are self-correcting, but that doesn't happen if voters ""are poorly organized, or they fail to understand their own interests correctly.""decay happens when agencies that are supposed to serve the public are captured by elites, or overmanaged by elected officials, or buffeted by what robert kagan calls ""adversarial legalism."" basically, fukuyama makes an argument for competent, uncorrupted bureaucrats - ""public servants,"" as they were once known. his model of an agency shattered by conflicting political mandates and poor management is the u.s. forest service, which went from a ""gold standard"" mission of managing forest resources to a secondary (and misconceived) goal of preventing forest fires.""it would be one thing if the u.s. forest service were an isolated case of political decay,"" fukuyama writes. unfortunately, ""the overall quality of the american government has been deteriorating steadily for more than a generation.""the deep anti-government hostility of the modern republican party is part of the problem. tax cuts have starved many government agencies of money and good people. fukuyama notes that medicare and medicaid, which account for 22 percent of the federal budget, are managed by 0.2 percent of federal workers. as the federal workforce has dwindled, the number of contractors has exploded. taxpayers suspect that it's a con, and they're right.congress meddles with the federal agencies rather than passing legislation to solve problems. fukuyama notes that the pentagon is mandated to send congress nearly 500 reports a year. ""the united states is trapped in a bad equilibrium,"" fukuyama writes. ""congress mandates complex rules that reduce the government's autonomy and make decisions slow and expensive. the government then doesn't perform well, which confirms people's original distrust.""an angry public watches as the rich get richer, the middle class stagnates and government does nothing. middle-class prosperity and self-confidence have been the foundation of u.s. democracy. yet the pew research center estimates that the share of household income going to middle-class families fell from 62 percent in 1970 to 43 percent in 2014, while the share for upper-income families rose from 29 percent to 49 percent.trump gives an angry america someone to blame: muslims, mexicans, government bureaucrats, free-trade negotiators, politicians, journalists. but he doesn't begin to address the real problem of how to fix the united states' political decay.""no one living in an established liberal democracy should . . . be complacent about the inevitability of its survival,"" warns fukuyama. or as benjamin franklin put it in 1787: ""a republic, if you can keep it.""",Congress

return the favor.the contrasts in trump-era education policy and the incoming biden agenda are stark. ms. devos, a lifelong booster of private schools and opponent of the teachers' unions, set out to reduce the education department's footprint by proposing cuts to public school funding and narrowing the department's enforcement of federal education laws and civil rights.the incoming first lady,

resources for public schools, expand civil rights advocacy for marginalized students and reassert department leadership in policymaking.on the most pressing issue facing education, reopening schools during the pandemic, the biden administration has signaled a sharply different approach.the trump administration has demanded that schools reopen, despite severe budget constraints and confusing health guidelines, while the education department has all but absolved itself of tracking the virus's impact and offering solutions. the biden campaign has promised federal relief funding and assistance for schools to address the devastating effects of the pandemic on the academic trajectory of their most vulnerable students.but the president-elect's closeness with the powerful teachers' unions has raised concerns. unions have come under fire from parents and school leaders who say their opposition to in-person instruction conflicts with science and students' well-being. ms. devos posted a series of articles on twitter that have questioned the unions' roles.""when unions win, kids lose,"" she said.with a likely republican senate and a narrow democratic majority in the house, mr. biden will struggle to accomplish some of his loftiest policy goals. he has promised to bolster funding for special education, institute universal prekindergarten and triple funding for a federal program that helps schools serving high concentrations of students from low-income families, devoting some of that funding to teacher salaries. in higher education, he has promised free public college, expanding federal financial aid and canceling some student debt.stef feldman, the biden campaign's policy director, told reporters last month that mr. biden would ""be able to get some big, bold education legislation passed and certainly immediate relief for our schools and our educators, but that doesn't mean that we're not also going to take executive action within existing authority.""those actions could come quickly.mr. biden has promised to appoint a secretary with teaching experience and a deep knowledge of the challenges schools and students face.in his victory speech on nov. 7, the president-elect referred to dr. biden as he declared: ""for america's educators, this is a great day. you're going to have one of your own in the white house.""the biden administration plans to restore obama-era civil rights guidance -- rescinded by ms. devos -- that allowed transgender students to choose their school bathrooms, addressed the disproportionate disciplining of black students and pressed for diversity in colleges and k-12 classrooms. the restoration of those guidance documents can be done immediately because they were not put through the regulatory process or enacted into law.undoing what is arguably ms. devos's most formidable accomplishment -- rules for federally funded schools investigating sexual misconduct -- could be tougher. the incoming administration has vowed to dismantle those rules. as vice president, mr. biden had personally helped introduce the obama-era guidelines on campus sexual misconduct that ms. devos reversed through formal rule-making.but unlike guidance documents, which do not carry the force of law, and other devos regulatory measures that have been overturned by courts, the sexual misconduct rules have already held up against legal challenges. the rules would have to be overturned through legislation or rewritten through the regulatory system, a process that could take years.mr. biden's team is also eyeing ms. devos's formal rules that tightened obama-era regulations on loan forgiveness for students defrauded by their colleges and that eased oversight of for-profit colleges. those rules could also require regulatory action if they survive court challenges.the administration is likely to prioritize the immense backlog of loan forgiveness claims that the trump administration let pile up, and the denials of assistance the department has issued to students who claim they were cheated by their colleges, according to officials familiar with the plans. among the thousands of students awaiting relief are those who attended corinthian colleges, a now defunct for-profit college chain that vice president-elect kamala harris sued as attorney general of california.""there's a lot of work to be done, but it will be nice to know there's an education secretary who's thinking about how to protect students from predatory schools instead of the other way around,"" said aaron ament, the president of the national student legal defense network, which has sued the department for its rollbacks of loan forgiveness and consumer protection rules.the team mr. biden has named to help the education department through the transition signaled the direction he intends to take.leading the team is linda darling-hammond, the president of the palo alto, calif.-based learning policy institute, who also oversaw the education transition for mr. obama in 2008. ms. darling-hammond, a veteran researcher and policymaker in arenas like desegregation, school finance and teacher preparation, was considered a contender for mr. biden's secretary of education, but took herself out of the running, saying she was committed to her work in california.the transition team's strong representation from former obama-era officials and teachers' unions has been met with mixed reactions.keri rodrigues, the president of the national parents union, which represents low-income parents and parents of color, said the composition of the team made her worried that the biden administration might stack the government with people who are ""interested in fortifying the status quo that has been failing so many of our kids.""""this is the biggest table right now,"" she said of the transition team, ""and i don't see parent groups, family groups, community groups present."" she added, ""it seems we're back to the same old, 'we're going to do things to you, not with you.""'unions were not seen as key players in the obama administration's coalition -- the national education association called for the resignation of mr. obama's first education secretary, arne duncan -- and have been at odds with centrist democrats on some policy issues, such as charter schools, which are supported by many black and latino families. mr. biden this summer reshaped the democratic platform to embrace a ban on federal funding for for-profit charters, and to call for cutting funding to underperforming charters run by nonprofit organizations.""he's coming in saying he wants to unify people, and it'll be interesting to see whether that holds for education policy,"" said charles barone, the director of policy at democrats for education reform. ""if you really respect the role of people who got you elected, are you going to come in and attack the choices they make for their children?""teachers' unions have curried favor by fighting ms. devos at every turn, but mr. biden's alliance with them has raised concerns.""if it looks like the teachers' unions are now calling the shots, and not the people schools are supposed to be serving, the pendulum will swing the other way,"" said neal mccluskey, the director of the libertarian cato institute's center for educational freedom.mr. biden has echoed union concerns that the country needs to get the coronavirus under control to safely reopen schools, and that it will take a large infusion of cash to meet safety guidelines and the needs of students who have suffered academic and social setbacks.""schools, they need a lot of money to open,"" mr. biden said during the last presidential debate, citing the need for better ventilation systems, smaller class sizes and more teachers.while mr. trump has emphasized low infection rates among children, mr. biden has also stressed concerns for educators. during one of the debates, after mr. trump accused him of wanting to keep the country locked down, mr. biden mocked the president: ""all you teachers out there, not that many of you are going to die, so don't worry about it.""becky pringle, the national education association's president, said mr. biden understood that ""no school system budget has a line item that says, 'coronavirus.""'ms. pringle noted that mr. biden had always been a strong supporter of the labor movement and said she was proud that he had also ""leaned in"" to the association's playbook.""he'll take the slings and arrows for being 'too close' to us, and he'll be able to say, 'not only did they help me get elected, they help me lead in a bold way,""' she said.union leaders top speculative short lists of contenders to be the next education secretary and will undoubtedly influence mr. biden's choice. randi weingarten, the president of the american federation of teachers, and lily eskelsen garcía, a past president of the national education association, are among the names mentioned.other names include superintendents of districts like baltimore and seattle, and representative jahana hayes, democrat of connecticut and a former national teacher of the year.ms. weingarten said that she was honored by the mention, but that she would be ""really happy to work with the biden administration as the president of the a.f.t.""""the biden-harris administration has the potential to enable a renaissance in public education,"" she said.",Department of Education

right to provide financial support for his son, despite hurley's opposition.1. donald brenchairman, irvine co. // 74, newport beachsimply put, orange county looks like orange county--much of it uniformly manicured and catering to the high life and high tech-- because of the influence of one man. uc irvine, fashion island, the irvine spectrum, university research park, newport coast, orange county's thousands of acres of wilderness and parkland and its enviable public school systems all bear bren's imprint. so does the new majority, a growing coalition of wealthy, socially moderate republicans who helped vault gov. arnold schwarzenegger, an old skiing buddy of bren, into office. he's the richest man in orange county--worth an estimated $7.5 billion, according to the o.c. business journal--and has been snapping up property in century city, san diego and the silicon valley as well. he is publicity-shy and enigmatic but don't let his style fool you: bren's involvement can mean life or death for a voter initiative, political campaign or philanthropic cause. his priorities are education, conservation (penance for a guy who has paved over a good chunk of the county?) and continuing to lift the o.c. out of l.a.'s long, but ever- shortening, shadow.2. eli broadcivic leader // 73, brentwoodit's one thing to be rich. it's another to use your money--in broad's case, $5.6 billion, according to the l.a. business journal-- to insert yourself into virtually every major decision affecting the civic life of a city. broad's zeal for a renaissance in downtown l.a. saved disney hall when lagging donations threatened to turn it into an expensive underground garage. he has given us a serious high school for the arts while shaping the museum of contemporary art, the los angeles county museum of art and the grand avenue project. he's also expressed an interest in buying the times. broad has heaped a fortune on caltech, ucla, pitzer and usc, which this year received $25 million to create a stem-cell research institute named for him. his foundation trains public school superintendents, he recruited roy romer to head the los angeles unified school district and he now supports mayoral control of lausd--so strongly that he recently spanked mayor antonio villaraigosa for ceding too much power to the teachers unions. before all this, broad made his mark in other ways: his homebuilding company, kaufman & broad, sowed greater l.a. with middle-class ranch houses--what some would call the region's signature sprawl.3. barbara e. kerrpresident, california teachers assn. // 59, riversideit's not clear if kerr has ever gotten her first-grade class in riverside to listen. but she sure has the attention of the mayor and governor. no issue is more critical to the future of the region than education, and nobody wields more influence in this arena than does kerr, president of the 335,000-member union. with united teachers los angeles president a.j. duffy stepping back and letting her do most of the talking, kerr engineered the deal in june with villaraigosa that would, among other things, strip power from the lausd board and give individual teachers much more sway over classroom instruction. critics say the mayor caved in to the unions, but it's no surprise that kerr has villaraigosa's ear. under her direction, the cta helped defeat villaraigosa's opponent, incumbent james hahn, with a tv attack ad in 2005. the lausd deal must next pass muster in sacramento, where kerr knows how to mix it up. just look what she did to gov. schwarzenegger last year after he reneged on an education-funding agreement. kerr and her troops went to war, helping defeat a slate of special election ballot measures that schwarzenegger was pushing. who's the terminator now?4. antonio villaraigosalos angeles mayor // 53, windsor squaremuch of his power is derived simply from his position as head of the region's biggest city. but it's far more than that. with seemingly boundless energy, villaraigosa is bent on putting his stamp on all of the local hot-button issues of the day--crime, transportation and education--in a way that his predecessors never managed. he has forged close ties with the city council, winning easy passage of his first budget and an increase in trash collection fees to pay for more cops. although he is l.a.'s first latino mayor in more than 130 years--making him an important symbol locally and nationally--villaraigosa has worked hard to embrace different communities throughout the city. his detractors say he is perpetually in campaign mode and can be weak on policy details. and he has taken plenty of lumps on the lausd deal. but villaraigosa still has the benefit of the doubt from all the players who really count, be they in the union halls; the legislature, where he once called the shots as assembly speaker; or the governor's office.5. roger mahonyarchbishop, archdiocese of l.a. // 70, los angeleswith 5 million roman catholics in l.a., ventura and santa barbara counties, mahony boasts a huge flock, especially in the latino community. some say the church's sex abuse scandal has undermined his influence, but there's another way to look at it: mahony's ability to keep secret the files of priests suspected of misconduct underscores just how powerful he is. (the church was compelled in april to turn over internal documents to a los angeles county grand jury, but mahony is still resisting in civil cases.) all the while, he remains a force in the immigration debate. the we are america coalition used pleas from mahony to help turn out hundreds of thousands of protesters in may. mahony has also helped change the face of downtown with the $200-million cathedral of our lady of the angels--a concrete and alabaster edifice that wags have dubbed the ""taj mahony"" and ""rog mahal.""6. philip anschutzindustrialist // 66, denversouthern california has more than its share of absentee landlords. few, however, have had as much impact as anschutz, who forbes says is now worth $6.4 billion. the tycoon made his first fortune in oil and gas and built a 130-mile pipeline from kern county to wilmington. he owns staples center, the home depot center in carson, the kings hockey team, the galaxy soccer franchise and (with ed roski) nearly 30% of the lakers. staples has been an anchor in the revitalization of downtown los angeles, and anschutz's entertainment company aeg--operating through l.a.-based lieutenant tim leiweke--plans to spend more than $1 billion to construct an adjacent hotel and commercial development that promises to inject even more life into the area. anschutz is also a mover in hollywood, with a controlling interest in movie theater chain regal entertainment and an eye for producing films geared toward children and families. he's had his misses--""around the world in 80 days"" was a box-office dud--but ""the chronicles of narnia"" served as a $1- billion lesson to the rest of the industry on the profitability of family entertainment.7. henry samuelicofounder, broadcom corp. // 51, corona del marsamueli isn't your typical orange county mogul. sure, he owns the anaheim ducks hockey franchise and the company that manages the arrowhead pond. but before his net worth swelled to $2.4 billion (according to forbes), this son of holocaust survivors ran a liquor store. samueli became a professor of electrical engineering at ucla, and today is the named inventor on 36 u.s. patents; besides serving as chairman of chip maker broadcom, he remains its chief technical officer. the youngest member of the top 10 list, samueli is a rising star in regional affairs, where he has given more than $160 million mostly to educational and healthcare institutions. two engineering schools are named after him (at ucla and uc irvine), and a center for alternative medicine at uci is named for his wife, susan. samueli may become even more of a household name if he realizes his next dream: bringing an nba franchise to anaheim.8. jerry bruckheimertv and film producer // 61, l.a. and bloomfield, ky.nobody in hollywood has more clout these days than this master of screens big and small. his new release, ""pirates of the caribbean: dead man's chest,"" has shattered box-office records. each one of bruckheimer's movies is a mega-operation, supporting hundreds of local jobs (even when filming occurs elsewhere), and a substantial part of the next chapter in the ""pirates"" trilogy is slated to be shot in an old aircraft hangar in palmdale, a big lift for regional film production. but in some respects, it's in tv where bruckheimer is making the deepest impression. he is the producer of eight prime- time series now on the air--two shy of the record he set last season. these include his ""csi"" franchise, ""without a trace,"" ""cold case"" and his hit reality series ""the amazing race."" as much as anything, it was bruckheimer's move into prime-time television in 2000 that helped lift the stigma of working in the genre and signaled the start of l.a.'s shift from tinseltown to tv town. with that has come a boom in tv shoots--and many thousands of jobs for actors, writers, craftspeople and more.9. david gelbaumconservationist // 57, newport beachyou may never have heard of him and, at just 5-foot-5 with a slight build and soft-spoken demeanor, gelbaum may not seem particularly powerful. but by donating more to conservation causes than anyone in the state--anonymously--this hedge-fund multimillionaire has taken a leading role in safeguarding something near and dear to the hearts of many here: the outdoors. under the guidance of politically savvy environmentalist david myers, gelbaum's gifts have protected enough mountain and desert land to create another yosemite national park, and his donations to wilderness education programs have sent nearly half a million inner- city schoolchildren to the mountains, desert or beach, many for the first time. crucial tracts of the mojave national preserve have been protected, thanks to the wildlands conservancy, which gelbaum cofounded. these days, the conservancy finds itself in the thick of the debate over the development of tejon ranch in the teha-chapi mountains. the gelbaum-backed group, along with the sierra club and others, wants to reduce the amount of the ranch that will be paved and preserve 245,000 acres as wilderness-- a tussle that will help define the limits of growth in southern california.10. haim sabanmedia mogul // 61, beverly hillswe'll be honest: saban wouldn't have cracked the top 10 a few months ago. but his recent involvement in a deal to buy l.a.-based univision communications, by far the nation's largest spanish- language broadcaster, catapulted him to the fore. though saban doesn't have nearly as much money in the $13.7-billion purchase as do the private-equity firms with which he's partnered, it will be largely up to him to figure out where the company goes from here--a vision that will ultimately be reflected in millions of tv sets throughout southern california. that's because saban (who speaks five languages, including spanish) is the one with an extensive background in entertainment and media, having built his wealth (estimated at $3.1 billion by the los angeles business journal) on mighty morphin power rangers cartoons and the sale of fox family worldwide. saban's civic involvement has run more to national and international issues than local ones. however, he gave $40 million to childrens hospital los angeles, where wife cheryl serves on the board, and he has been a major supporter of the motion picture & television fund, which helps provide for those in the business who are in need.the next 90n. christian anderson iiipublisher and ceo, orange county register; 56, coto de cazait's tough to admit it, but anderson, a virtual lifer at orange county's leading newspaper, first as editor and then as publisher, waged a block-by-block newspaper war with the l.a. times on its home front until tribune co. bought the times and all but waved the white flag. it's impossible to ""out-local the locals,"" anderson said then. in proving his point, he has solidified o.c.'s separate identity in southern california.lee bacal.a. county sheriff; 64, san marinohis 8,000 deputies protect 2.7 million people and guard america's biggest jail system. turnover is high, homicides are up and 150,000 inmates have been released early over the last four years amid crowded conditions that a federal judge called ""not consistent with basic human values."" yet baca--so quirky that he is known within law enforcement circles as ""sheriff moonbeam""--just won a third term with ease.dean baqueteditor, l.a. times; 49, santa monicayeah, we know what some will say: how self-serving to put your boss on the list. but baquet, who won a pulitzer prize in chicago and served as the new york times' national editor before coming to l.a. in 2000, sets the agenda for the most powerful media voice in the region. with resources shrinking, how well baquet weathers budget pressures from long-distance owner tribune co. will go a long way toward determining how robust that voice remains.steve barrfounder, small schools alliance;47, silver lakethrough his green dot charter high schools, he's been a serious pain for the l.a. school district, luring away top teachers, organizing a parents union, launching five charter schools near jefferson high after the district rebuffed his takeover offer, testifying in sacramento and, along with california charter schools assn. head caprice young, generally ratcheting up the debate over the future of public education.stephen l. bingreal estate heir, 41; los angelesbing is perhaps best known for getting socked by actress-model elizabeth hurley with a successful paternity suit. but he is the playboy with a bit of policy wonk in him. last year he spent $4 million to deep-six proposition 77, the redistricting initiative. now the big democratic donor is bankrolling a measure to help fund alternative energy. bing also invests heavily in film projects and gives lots of dough anonymously to local causes, including education and the environment. recently spotted dining at jar with villaraigosa.bishop charles e. blakepastor, west angeles church of god in christ; 66, beverly hillswith the rev. cecil l. ""chip"" murray retired from first ame church in south l.a., blake has become the man to see when courting favor in the city's african american community. with 24,000 members, his congregation is among the largest in southern california. villaraigosa--who is close with blake's son-in-law, fallen labor leader martin ludlow--sat up front at a recent service, and the democratic gubernatorial candidates came by to pump blake's hand.william j. brattonl.a. police chief; 58, los felizhe's more than a law-and-order man; he's a celebrity, and with that comes the power of celebrity. as recent events show, bratton is tough enough to take on the city council--and savvy enough to know when to kiss and make up. politicians seek his endorsement, and other chiefs across the country look to his example. most importantly, he's been quite effective, restoring a measure of order and dignity to the long-suffering (and, some would add, insufferable) lapd.harry ""skip"" brittenhamentertainment attorney;64, santa monicaoperating largely under the radar, the highly trusted and intensely competitive brittenham represents more top studio executives than any other hollywood lawyer, while also counting among his clients some of the town's biggest a-list stars--tom hanks included--and major corporations. indeed, brittenham has factored into virtually every huge deal in hollywood over the last two decades, including the sales of dreamworks skg to viacom and pixar animation studios to disney.james brultegovernment affairs consultant;50, fontanaas the former gop leader of both state houses before he was termed- out of the legislature, brulte has deep connections that run clear to the white house. he hangs his hat these days at california strategies, a top political consulting firm. brulte was the founding member of the budding inland empire chapter of the new majority, and has filed to run for the state board of equalization in four years. meanwhile, gov. schwarzenegger has enlisted him to frame debates with phil angelides, and on the other side of the aisle, he delivered crucial support for villaraigosa's election.ron burkleinvestor; managing partner,yucaipa cos.; 53, beverly hillsthe billionaire, who just missed our top 10 list, maintains close relationships with politicians of all stripes (from villaraigosa to former gov. pete wilson) and is said to give generously (and anonymously) to local causes. a big friend of labor, the onetime supermarket magnate dispenses advice to the united food and commercial workers. he has been involved with trying to bring an nfl team to l.a., and he's signaled interest in buying the times.jerry bussowner, l.a. lakers and l.a. sparks,73, playa vistasome fans will never forgive him for letting relations between his two top players fester and ultimately casting his lot with kobe over shaq (who just picked up another championship ring in miami). but the fact remains: in spite of the clippers' rise, the lakers remain the no. 1 show in a sports-obsessed town. its games are the place to be seen by hollywood royalty and myriad other power brokers, and buss is the man who has engineered the spectacle for more than 25 years, bringing eight championships to town.rick carusodeveloper; 47, brentwooda kitsch-meister? perhaps. but the developer of the grove, the outdoor mall adjacent to the l.a. farmers market; the americana at brand near the glendale galleria; and other retail-entertainment projects has altered the shopping landscape and transformed neighborhoods. the former head of the l.a. police commission can play tough too: when opponents tried to stop him in glendale, he beat back a ballot initiative and then sued his rivals.dov charneyfounder and ceo, american apparel;37, los angeleshe's gotten into some hot water for creating a sexually charged atmosphere at his company, but this outspoken advocate for immigrant rights has made his mark in a more profound way as well: he has shown that you can compensate your workers decently and still compete in the local garment business. charney's downtown l.a. factory is the largest single apparel plant in the nation, employing 3,800 workers, the vast majority of whom are latino. he pays an average of $12.50 an hour, and many of his workers purchase cheap, company-subsidized health insurance and enjoy other perks.siu-man chiul.a. county health specialist;50, temple citychiu has dispensed letter grades at hundreds of chinese restaurants in the san gabriel valley. there's no way to be sure if she and her colleagues reduced hospitalizations for food-borne illness--13% countywide, according to one study--but we feel better about our kung pao knowing that chiu has been on the case.sean collinssurf forecaster;

77, santa monicathe west coast's reigning star architect languished in l.a. for years. but he started to roll in the early 1990s, and since its completion in 2003, disney hall has made gehry a symbol of l.a.'s creative life. he's now working on the grand avenue project, intended to give downtown l.a. a residential-commercial heart. in five years, it'll be easy to look back and see how many local buildings, from low-slung westside homes to downtown skyscrapers, are his.jim gilchristanti-illegal immigration activist;57, aliso viejoa retired accountant, this cofounder of the minuteman project and his volunteers began patrolling the arizona-mexico border last year with private planes and night-vision goggles. the unsuccessful congressional candidate has put fresh heat on a perennial hot button, fomenting debate--and division--from national political circles to hometown parades in places such as laguna beach and pacific palisades.kevin goetzmanaging director; executive vice president, otx; 44, studio citygot a blockbuster in the pipeline? chances are that goetz will have something to say about how it gets released. the hottest market research company in hollywood is otx, where goetz and his team provide studios with tracking information about audience interest in upcoming films. a former child actor who has appeared in many commercials--he was the domino's pizza boy for a couple of years-- goetz personally tests about five movies a week and has a hand in about half the flicks that leave hollywood.stanley p. goldceo, shamrock capital advisors; chairman, usc board of trustees;64, beverly hillsgold may be best known for joining with his associate, roy disney, to lead a shareholder revolt against walt disney co. and then-ceo michael eisner in 2004. but gold's local influence has long reached beyond hollywood. shamrock, the disney family's investment company, manages a $150-million fund that puts money into low- to moderate-income neighborhoods around l.a. it also owns industrial and commercial properties in koreatown, carson and other parts of the southland. gold himself has made millions in gifts to usc, where he has chaired the board since 2002.nick haquerestaurateur; 40, hollywooda certain clout comes with being the owner of the hottest restaurant in l.a., and as the owner of koi, haque hasn't been shy about exploiting it. celebrities are thick on the ground at his establishments, which include bridge, and haque's anti-paparazzi system is said to be one of the most elaborate and hardest to crack in the city. nonetheless, rumor has it that at least one celebrity magazine has spent thousands of dollars on meals at koi just so gossip columnists could sit in the dining room and report on star sightings.antonia hernandezpresident and ceo, california community foundation; 58, pasadenathe foundation--which boasts assets of $800 million and shepherds tens of millions of dollars in donations to local nonprofits each year--is one of the most vital philanthropic organizations in l.a. county. since taking charge of the group in 2004, hernandez has pushed it in new directions, focusing on quality-of-life issues for the elderly and at-risk youth while steering away from job training and other areas where it has been harder to show gains. before coming to the foundation, hernandez for 18 years headed the mexican american legal defense and educational fund.robert hertzbergattorney; 52, sherman oaksthe former california assembly speaker is one of the few local politicians with credibility and solid connections on both the left and the right, as evidenced by hertzberg's working relationships with villaraigosa and schwarzenegger. although hertzberg lost his bid for mayor of los angeles, he remains a discreet advisor on civic issues such as economic development, transportation and term limits, and he's an important champion for the san fernando valley.alan hornpresident, warner bros.; environmentalist; 63, bel-airwarner bros. has had a disappointing summer at the box office with ""poseidon"" and ""lady in the water,"" but horn gets high marks across hollywood for being a class act and a solid guy. he makes our list, though, for another reason: in between green-lighting movies, horn has shown himself to be green in another way, enlisting a bevy of entertainment executives to back the national resources defense council. now it's arguably the state's leading environmental organization and, with rob reiner (a former partner of horn at castle rock entertainment) and laurie david in its corner, one of the hottest causes on the west coast.deirdre 'deedie' hudnutadmissions director, the center forearly education // 58, beverly hillsit could just be a myth that los angeles' most sought-after elementary school(and a favorite among the elite of the entertainment industry) is step one on the southern california fast track to the ivy league. still, up to 1,000 applicants a year vie for about 60 slots there. hudnut shares the task of picking, but she's the one who does the bulk of the interviewing. incidentally, her husband is headmaster at harvard-westlake, the private high school that's step two, or so they say.john husingprincipal, economics & politics inc.; 65, redlandshusing provides economic analysis and counsel to every major city in the inland empire, as well as to both riverside and san bernardino counties and two community colleges. he has also been key (along with southern california leadership council co-chair bob wolf) in positioning the area as a logistics and transportation hub. in his private life, husing has trekked in the himalayas, but the biggest mountain he has climbed is convincing people that the inland empire--long regarded as a backwater--is now a potent economic force.robert igerceo, walt disney co.; 55, brentwoodlong gone are the days when one entertainment chief--namely, mca's lew wasserman--was so powerful that his presence transcended all of hollywood. today, top executives pretty much keep their heads down. but walt disney co. is simply too big a fish--or should that be mouse?--to ignore with 30,000 employees in l.a. and orange counties. iger, of course, is at the helm of it all, having been named ceo following the tumultuous reign of michael eisner. iger has quickly stepped out of eisner's shadow, acquiring pixar animation studios, continuing to shake up the disney board and taking steps to move the company forward through the application of new technologies.frank jaochairman and ceo, bridgecreek group // 57, huntington beachjao got his start in the 1970s with a strip of vacant industrial buildings that he turned into a shopping center serving his fellow vietnamese exiles. since then, the man known as the ""godfather of little saigon"" has owned or developed roughly three-quarters of orange county's best-known ethnic commercial enclave and remains the community's biggest landlord. some 1,500 business tenants lease space in the half a dozen developments he owns there, and his holdings keep expanding. his latest ventures include the district's first major residential project. also, coastline community college has opened a little saigon-area campus, thanks in part to his largesse.earvin ""magic"" johnsonurban developer; 46, beverly hillspeople believe in magic to the point that his mere involvement gives cautious corporate investors the confidence to venture into inner-city neighborhoods. his magic johnson theatres (a partnership with loews cineplex entertainment) are lighting up the crenshaw district more than a decade after the 1992 riots. his real estate fund (another partnership, with canyon capital realty advisors) has underwritten redevelopment in hollywood and downtown l.a. his deal with starbucks--he's its sole outside partner--has brought jobs (and $3 lattes) to more than three dozen low-income neighborhoods in southern california. his political endorsement is among l.a.'s most influential, and talk persists of his mayoral potential.lucile m. jonesseismologist, u.s. geological survey; 51, la canada-flintridgetechnically, jones is a specialist in earthquake probabilities, but for 20 years she's been the ""earthquake mom,"" calming the public after a temblor with her reassurance and expertise. she's also an outspoken member of the state's seismic safety commission. when schwarzenegger's administration tried to fire jones earlier this year (on the centennial of the san francisco quake, no less) the reverberations were so strong that the governor overruled the removal the same day.steve ""jonesy"" jonesindie rock deejay; former sex pistol; 50, benedict canyonhis playlist on kdld/kdle-fm (103.1) is pretty much whatever the bloke feels like 'earing, which has made ""jonesy's jukebox"" not just one of l.a.'s hottest radio shows but the source of a cottage industry in downloads and cd sales. virgin megastores now feature ""jonesy's picks"" sections. at least three fledgling bands have gotten major label deals because jonesy played them. and though the station doesn't match the ratings or signal strength of l.a.'s alt- rock big dog kroq-fm (106.7), it's credited with forcing rivals to get edgier or step aside.bruce karatzchairman, kb home; 60, bel-airin the homebuilding industry, karatz is known as a master marketer. he has spent two decades helming the former kaufman & broad home corp., the company that virtually created suburban southern california. his concept in 1996 of ""pre-selling"" homes before they're built--a revolutionary idea at the time--is now common. but beyond that, karatz is a major civic presence, serving over the years on many important local boards (from usc to rand corp.) and wading into democratic politics (though he backed the wrong horse--bob hertzberg--for mayor).jeffrey katzenbergceo, dreamworks animation;cofounder, dreamworks skg;55, beverly hillskatzenberg not only leads the chief competitor to disney in the animation arena, but he has evolved into an important civic presence. a major fundraiser for aids service and treatment organizations, katzenberg also chairs the motion picture and television fund, which underwrites home healthcare and housing for the needy who have worked in the entertainment industry.geraldine knatzexecutive director, port of l.a.; 54, long beachknatz came to the port of l.a. this year from the neighboring port of long beach, giving her a thorough understanding of the nation's biggest harbor complex. together, the ports generate some 500,000 jobs, dwarfing other major industries here. but until knatz made her move, l.a. and long beach behaved like bitter rivals, creating a chronic obstacle to air-quality improvement. now, with knatz reaching out to her old boss, port of long beach executive director richard steinke, the two appear destined to work together on pollution reduction and more. ""she gets up at 4:45 in the morning and kicks butt all day,"" one admirer has said.john kobylt and ken chiampoutalk-radio hosts; 45 and 50, beverly hills and hermosa beach, respectivelyok, ok. we know these are two names (technically making our list the west 101). but there is no way to separate john and ken, the guys behind l.a.'s top-rated afternoon-drive talk show on kfi-am (640). whether you agree with them or not, the impact of their angry- white-guy campaigns is unmistakable. when villaraigosa declared that the nation relies on immigrant workers, saying, ""we clean your toilets,"" john and ken fans deluged city hall with more than 1,000 toilet brushes. their daily rants against gov. gray davis (gumby, they called him) were instrumental in the 2003 gubernatorial recall, as was their support of schwarzenegger, which has--uh-oh--been wavering.robin kramerchief of staff to mayor villaraigosa; 53, windsor squarepress-shy but preternaturally plugged in, kramer has been the right hand of so many downtown heavy-hitters that even she may have lost count. she was chief of staff to former l.a. councilman richard alatorre, then chief of staff to mayor richard riordan, then senior director of eli broad's foundation and now--after intensive lobbying by antonio himself--chief of staff for villaraigosa. her fingerprints are, by the nature of her job, invisible, but her name brings instant credibility to any boss or cause.tim leiwekepresident, aeg; 49, brentwoodas phil anschutz's l.a. lieutenant, leiweke handles dealings with the kings, the galaxy, home depot center and staples center, among other matters. but he is powerful enough to call his own shots too. lately he has shifted his attention overseas and ceded some local duties to others in his organization, but he's still the point man here, with unmatched influence over the sports and entertainment experience in l.a. and the future of the figueroa corridor.randall lewisreal estate developer; 55, claremontmuch of the inland empire looks the way it does because of the lewis family's homebuilding company. besides constructing houses, it also underwrote parks and theaters that still dot cities such as pomona and rancho cucamonga. randall's parents eventually sold their business, yet the lewis name remains dominant in inland empire real estate, with four sons specializing in master-planned communities and commercial projects. randall has emerged as the company's public presence, and other developers view him as a big thinker. among other things, he cofounded an influential educational alliance with arrowhead credit union president larry sharp (another inland empire power broker) and is promoting a set of locally based public health initiatives.mark lisantieditor, defamer.com // 32, silver lakewith 8.5 million page views a month, lisanti has proved how scary an irreverent guy blogging in his underwear can be. he--and the legion of celebutainment gossips mimicking his mouthy online persona- -have shortened the news cycle from 12 hours to 15 minutes and irreversibly changed the tenor and power structure of hollywood coverage as old media has chugged to catch up. sure, the couch tom cruise jumped on belonged to oprah. but it was lisanti's cellphone- snapped photomontage of the episode and hilarious commentary that ricocheted wildly online until they wound up going mainstream, ensuring the star's rapid public-opinion plummet.richard lovettpresident, creative artists agency;46, brentwoodunder lovett, bryan lourd and five other partners, caa has earned a rep as the microsoft of talent agencies, snapping up rivals and scooping up clients so that making a movie without them is now next to impossible. they've also branched into sports managment, signing slugger derek jeter and quarterback peyton manning. caa has also snagged xbox wizard seamus blackley to guide it in the burgeoning market for video-game deals--an area that has become an l.a. power center in its own right (especially since industry giant electronic arts opened a giant playa vista games studio in 2003).william lyonchairman and ceo, william lyon homes inc.; 83, coto de cazafor decades, lyon has been one of the first calls politicians make when they need support in orange county, and it's not because he's a soft touch. a major o.c. homebuilder, new majority member and chairman of team california, the state gop's pro-arnold fundraising campaign, lyon is inordinately influential, both within his party and his industry. lyon also gives time and money to a range of causes, including the orangewood children's foundation and the orange county center for the performing arts.hadi makarechianchairman, capital pacific holdings; 58, newport beachever wonder why so many orange county republican fundraisers happen to take place at the st. regis monarch beach resort and spa in dana point? hint: the hotel's developers are local gop heavyweights, hadi makarechian and his son, paul. the elder makarechian made a fortune in construction on the east coast, retired in 1990 to california, then made another fortune building coastal mcmansions. a board member of orange county's new majority, he has donated prodigiously to schwarzenegger and his various initiatives. meanwhile, paul, a fledgling commercial developer, has helped launch gennext, a new majority spinoff for younger gop members.alfred e. mannbiotech entrepreneur; 80, beverly hillshis biotech ventures--11 at last count--have involved pacemakers, insulin pumps and much more. the alfred e. mann institute is an incubator for biomedical research. (usc was granted the $100- million-plus gift after the billionaire got fed up with the red tape at ucla, his alma mater.) but perhaps just as important, the 167- acre mann biomedical park, which houses several of his start-ups, spawned a biotech cluster that has perked up valencia.richard meruelodeveloper; 41, whittiermeruelo is said to be the largest private landowner in downtown l.a., controlling more than 100 properties with millions of square feet. but what made political types really take notice was the $197,300 he spent last year--more than any individual--to help elect villaraigosa. now he's making headlines for his aggressive real estate tactics. among them: battling architecture school sci-arc out of a downtown property it wanted and getting barred for five years from developing a parcel near union station as punishment for demolishing structures on it without a permit.michael milkeninvestor, philanthropist; 60, encinoyes, there will probably always be that boilerplate: ""disgraced former junk bond king."" but milken has been tireless in his other life as a philanthropist. he and his family have donated more than $750 million--a fifth of it locally--over the last three decades. and he doesn't just give; he takes on causes, with education high on the list. additionally, his underwriting of research into life- threatening diseases (cancer runs in his family) has meant new treatments for leukemia and breast cancer at ucla. to top it off, his milken institute is a leader in analyzing the local economy.arturo ""arte"" morenoowner of the angels; 60, phoenixmoreno's first act upon taking over the angels in 2003 was to endear himself to fans: he cut ticket and beer prices. later, he forced anaheim to let him wedge some other nearby city into its home team's name. orange county-ites and dodgers devotees in l.a. protested, but moreno hung tough and his strategy is paying off. sports junkies from all over southern california feel increasingly free to root for the angels. moreno has also moved into spanish- language radio, the team has signed a lucrative broadcast rights contract, and forbes recently estimated that the team is now worth about twice what moreno paid.david murdockchairman, dole food co. andcastle & cooke; 83, hidden valleythe billionaire has been a big local political donor and a philanthropic pioneer. when he built a $4.5-million communal housing complex for the mentally ill near camarillo last year, the state's mental health director praised him for having ""set the model for the state."" now, the health-conscious murdock (he's a self-professed ""fish vegetarian"" and has pushed dole heavily into nutrition research) is off on a new venture: he has brought in a ucla scientist and insurer wellpoint inc. to help create the must-have reservation for well-off southland boomers. scheduled to open in november in westlake village, the california wellbeing institute four seasons portends an evolving niche: luxury healthcare.brian murphychairman, southern california music for live nation; 58, studio citythere are more important tastemakers in the concert world--paul tollett's annual coachella music and arts festival, for one. but murphy's company, spun off in december by clear channel entertainment, recently acquired its largest competitor, house of blues concerts, and thereby strengthened its dominance in deciding what we hear.sam nazarianceo, sbe entertainment group; 31, beverly hillswith his father's real estate business as a leg up and club impresario brent bolthouse as a partner, nazarian has taken control of most of the velvet ropes in l.a. the newly remodeled privilege; the soon-to-reopen area; the celebrity petting zoo of the moment, hyde; the swank supper club lobby--they all are nazarian's. at the reopening of privilege in july, the crowd spilled onto sunset boulevard like fans at a hollywood premiere. next up: a chain of japanese restaurants, katsuya, the first of which just opened in brentwood.dominic ngchairman, east west bank; 47, pasadenang has taken ethnic banking mainstream. at east west, founded in chinatown in 1973 and now the second-largest commercial bank based in southern california, the staff greets customers in spanish and vietnamese as well as cantonese, mandarin and english. the company's stock price has tripled this decade. meanwhile, ng raised record funds for the united way of greater los angeles by bringing in new donors, solidifying his leadership in philanthropy as well as finance.henry t. ""nick"" nicholas iiiinvestor; philanthropist; cofounder, broadcom corp.; 46, newport coastthough best known for his gigantic ego, intense work style and high-profile marital problems, there's no doubting the import of nicholas' influence. with broadcom cofounder samueli, he helped give orange county a new high-tech gloss. and as a local philanthropist, he's heaped millions on the arts and a range of education and technology projects. the billionaire has also donated vast sums to law-and-order causes, his interest stemming from his sister's murder 23 years ago. nicholas is credited, in particular, with fending off an overhaul of the state's three-strikes law.bart o'brienplant guru // 50, uplandin 16 years as a senior horticulturalist at rancho santa ana botanic garden in claremont, the harvard-educated o'brien has achieved a cult following for his ideas on redefining beauty in the garden. out with chinese gardenias, in with california lilac. no one has done more to bring the glory of our native flora to the attention of nurseries, landscapers and gardeners. drive down any street in southern california and where lawn gives way to penstemons, monkeyflowers and poppies, an o'brien convert can be found.ronald l. olsonpartner, munger, tolles & olson;65, pasadenahis clients have ranged from the filipino government to warren buffett, but at home in l.a., he's one of the most sought-after power lawyers around. olson played a key role in minimizing damage to southern california edison during the energy crisis of 2001, and defended mike ovitz and his severance package against walt disney co. shareholders. he represented merrill lynch in the orange county bankruptcy and brad grey when his name came up in the anthony pellicano investigation. recently, the getty trust called on him amid its scandal.alexandra patsavasmusic supervisor // 38, pasadenaone snippet of a song playing in the background while, say, seth pines for summer on ""the oc"" and--boom--an indie rock star is born. patsavas, who picks songs for the hit show (as well as for ""grey's anatomy,"" ""without a trace"" and ""rescue me"") has become one of the most powerful gatekeepers in the entertainment business. each week she is deluged with cds from record labels, band managers and artists.anthony pellicanoprivate detective; 62, u.s. metropolitan detention center, los angeleshe's behind bars, where clout tends to be hard to come by. but information, as they say, is power, and pellicano--alleged wiretapper to the stars for more than a decade--has amassed reams of it in his long service to the city's most high-profile entertainment figures and their lawyers. in fact, one reason this list is short on l.a. attorneys is that so many have seen their power eroded because of the probe into pellicano, who--so far at least--claims not to have talked to the authorities.a. jerrold perenchiooutgoing chairman, univision communications inc.; 75, beverly hills""zelig-like"" was the way a recent times profile described perenchio's involvement in entertainment, politics and sports in the region (and nationally). he built univision into the nation's dominant spanish-language broadcaster, and recently sold out to an investment group that includes haim saban. his personal take is estimated at about $1.3 billion, leaving him poised to increase his philanthropic power. by some estimates, perenchio--malibu's largest landowner--has already given away many millions to disney hall, ucla and others. the ronald reagan ucla medical center, it is said, probably wouldn't be getting built without him. but quantifying his contributions isn't easy because perenchio's preference is to remain far under the radar.curt pringleanaheim mayor; 47, anaheimpringle has taken some heat for having lost anaheim's name- change fight with the angels and for struggling to muster consensus on courting the nfl. still, pringle is not only running unopposed, he's also been endorsed by his biggest critic. it's a testament to the skill and war chest of the ambitious gop leader of disneyland's hometown. more broadly, pringle has built such a strong reputation for his aggressive pro-business approach to governance (creative tax waivers, sweeping zone changes, market incentives to redevelop run- down parts of the city) that other local officials have coined a verb for his philosophy: ""to pringle-ize.""david pyottchairman and ceo, allergan inc.;52, san juan capistranohe's the man who took botox mainstream. it has been more than 15 years since allergan bought the rights to an obscure little treatment for eye spasms. when pyott became ceo in 1998, few outside the hollywood underground knew that botox could also smooth wrinkles. pyott ramped up spending on research and development, got the fda to approve botox for cosmetic uses and has marketed it so aggressively that it's all but a way of life in looks-conscious southern california. allergan's next possible blockbuster: juvederm, a dermal filler that reduces the appearance of lines and folds.connie ricelawyer; 50, altadenaan l.a. civil rights attorney (and the second cousin of secretary of state condi), she has weighed in on transportation, race relations and dysfunction within the lausd, among other things. most recently she chaired the blue ribbon rampart review panel, charged with providing a final accounting of the notorious police corruption scandal. as is rice's style, the report throws down a gauntlet, calling for an expansion of the lapd and an end to the culture of ""warrior police.""ramona ripstonexecutive director, aclu of southern california; 79, marina del reypolice abuse, jail crowding, reproductive rights, school desegregation, gay rights, crosses on l.a. county's seal--name a civil liberties fight, large or small, and ripston has fought it. of late, she has found herself defending plans to honor salam al- marayati, executive director of the muslim public affairs council. also recently, she was named by her old friend villaraigosa to l.a.'s commission on homelessness.fraser rossfounder, kitson boutique;

(he even has an investment in sunset photo and news.) ross also has a kids' store, an internet business, a soon-to-open men's store and a coming shoe line.edward ruschaartist; 69, venicewith surprisingly resonant images of otherwise banal subjects such as standard gas stations, a norms restaurant, the hollywood sign, parking lots and the sunset strip, ruscha has personified ""l.a. artist"" since the mid-1950s. perennially popular, he has gained increasing respect in the last decade, and in 2005 represented the united states at the venice biennale. this year, the l.a. county museum of art purchased 156 works from ruscha in an effort to acquire a complete set of his prints, while the museum of contemporary art elected him to its board of trustees.esa-pekka salonencomposer; conductor and music director, l.a. philharmonic; 48, los angelesthe dashing finn was a rising star when he arrived here 14 years ago. since then, he has matured into one of the world's most impressive conductors and composers, while turning the l.a. phil into the hippest, hottest cultural ticket in town. thanks to the orchestra's with-it image, the classical music audiences in disney hall are now urban, edgy, diverse--nothing like the dowdy crowds of yore.steven b. samplepresident, usc; 65, san marinoonce usc was branded the university of spoiled children. no longer. under sample's leadership, usc has become a magnet for foreign students, with nobel laureates on the faculty, average sat scores that rival ucla's and influential institutions such as the annenberg school for communication and the marshall school of business. sample is also a force on l.a. civic issues, reaching out to help develop the low-income neighborhoods around the campus.arnold schwarzeneggercalifornia governor; actor;59, brentwoodit's good to be the governator. good for southern kollyfornia too. though schwarzenegger is, of course, in charge of the entire state, his ties here create a special ripple effect. his bond initiative to buttress the state's infrastructure would, if it passes, have a disproportionate local impact. many of his closest advisors hail from the southland. and schwarzenegger's election has dramatically raised the profile of his republican backers in orange county's new majority.henry segerstromdeveloper; 83, newport beachthe patriarch of one of orange county's leading farm families, segerstrom famously turned a tract of bean fields into south coast plaza. the rest, as they say, is history. segerstrom has also been the major force behind the o.c. performing arts center, which will expand into a new hall in september--named, naturally, for the man and his family.muzammil siddiqireligious director, islamic societyof orange county; 62, fountain valleysiddiqi, whose mosque is among the largest in north america, is the religious leader of thousands of southern california muslims at a time when xenophobia is running high. after sept. 11, the white house invited him to preside over interfaith services at the national cathedral. since then, he has been a leader in driving home the point that muslims in the u.s. are peace-loving.nancy silvertonchef; restaurateur; 52, hancock parka big percentage of the current generation of l.a.'s chefs came from silverton's kitchen at campanile (which she founded with her ex- husband mark peel, who now pilots the place solo). with her weekly sandwich nights there, antipasto nights at la terza and mozzarella nights at jar, she's changed the way angelenos eat. she was the first baker to give all of l.a. access to artisan bread (at her la brea bakery, sold in 2001 for $56 million). and the restaurant she's about to open with mario batali, mozza, is the most highly anticipated in years.emily simonitschsenior vp, house of blues concerts; 53, glendalesimonitsch has helped bring latin music into the mainstream of cultural life in l.a. through her work at universal citywalk's gibson amphitheatre. when she started there in the '80s, julio iglesias was the only latin act who had played the venue;

35, los angeleswhen congress threatened to crack down on undocumented immigrants, sotelo--l.a.'s top-ranked morning deejay--gave organizers of a proposed pro-immigrant rally four hours on his program on ksca-fm (101.9). sotelo then worked with kbue-fm (105.5) host ricardo ""el mandril"" sanchez and others to pump up the volume. urging protesters to carry american flags and to be peaceful, the deejays summoned half a million or more to l.a.'s streets.steven spielbergmovie director; cofounder dreamworks skg; 59, pacific palisadesbeyond moviemaking, spielberg is perhaps best known as a worldwide force in jewish philanthropy. but his local impact is significant too. he has established a repository of 52,000 testimonies of holocaust survivors at usc, as well as given to the film school there. he has also been an active donor to the cedars- sinai medical center. the virtual megaphone attached to his fame, though, is his chief source of influence, and most any cause he champions (think driving a prius to the oscars) can become an instant trend, first in show business circles and then beyond.kevin starrhistory professor, usc; state librarian emeritus; author; 65, san franciscostarr's influence may ultimately last longer than anybody's on this list, because he is helping us to interpret what it means to be southern californians. some have criticized starr for being too boosterish. but his ""americans and the california dream"" series of books--now standing at six volumes, with nearly 10,000 pages--is dazzling in its breadth and depth of knowledge.marc sternfinancial executive; 62, malibustern has been the quintessential l.a. insider for decades, having served as the right hand to eli broad and robert day. he also has been a caltech trustee--long a position held by the real lions of los angeles--and an influential force in the arts world as chairman of the los angeles opera and a director of the performing arts center of l.a. county.caroline styneco-owner and wine director, aoc and lucques; 39, hancock parkchef suzanne goin's rustic-yet-refined cooking aesthetic is reason enough to frequent lucques and aoc, but it's styne's impressive range of wines by the glass that has shaken up the local restaurant world. before styne, l.a.'s wine scene was all about cult cabs and chardonnay. but she has inspired sommeliers at restaurants citywide to dare angelenos into becoming more adventurous drinkers and spawned a burgeoning wine-bar movement.trader joe's tasting panel, monroviawe cannot name them. we cannot show their faces. otherwise, trader joe would have to kill us, and that would mean no more chili lime peanuts and two-buck chuck for us. what we can say is that there are more than 10 of them and fewer than 40, and they're easily the most powerful group of food critics in southern california. the monrovia-based grocery chain has more weirdly addictive foods--and a more cult-like fan base--than probably any supermarket nationally. the reason is its expert tasting panel, which meets daily in secret to determine down to the last package of mandarin orange chicken what will go on the shelves of trader joe's groceries, which now number 256 in 20 states, including 82 stores regionally.peter ueberrothmanaging director, contrarian group inc.; chairman, u.s. olympic committee; 68, laguna beachhe was ceo of the 1984 l.a. olympic organizing committee and then baseball commissioner. in 1992, after the riots, he was brought in to head rebuild l.a. now, in the midst of his day job as a corporate turnaround artist, he and fellow members of the olympic committee board will determine which u.s. city, if any, bids for the 2016 summer games. among those under consideration: l.a.bill wardlawlawyer; 59, san marinowardlaw was a key advisor to two of the last three mayors, and he put l.a. councilman bernard parks through mock oral exams the first time he was running for lapd chief. he's a friend of supervisor zev yaroslavsky and has the ear of sen. dianne feinstein. wardlaw's clout has waned since villaraigosa's election--he had chaired james hahn's reelection campaign--but not much. the reason? he's an old friend of villaraigosa too. most importantly, the freeman spogli & co. attorney understands the crucial nexus in l.a. between democratic politics, labor politics and ethnic politics.rev. rick warrenpastor, saddleback church; 52, trabuco canyonhis congregation now numbers more than 20,000 and his weekend services are attended by one out of every nine people in south o.c. but that's all multiplied by the way the hawaiian-shirted warren deploys his flock, sending them out to enlist others in good works. bigger than harvest christian fellowship's greg laurie, cooler than crystal cathedral's robert schuller, people-friendlier than calvary chapel's chuck smith, warren is in a class by himself. and then there's his book, ""the purpose driven life.""kevin weatherlykroq-fm (106.7) program director; 43, calabasasthe most powerful rock signal west of the mississippi is kroq, and weatherly, in an era of blandly calculated playlists and national uniformity, is one of the last true hit makers in radio. whether it was sublime in the 1990s or the killers now, kroq relies on weatherly's instinct for picking the next star.richard ""wooly"" woolcottceo and president, volcom;40, laguna hillsrobert mcknight jr.'s quiksilver may have brought surf wear to the masses, but its designs aren't the cutting edge they used to be. with a film division, a record label, a robust online art gallery, skateparks, a grass-roots contest series called let the kids ride free and two brick-and-mortar retail stores, the volcom brand has become the new bridge between southern california's hard-core surf- skate-snow culture and the mainstream.zev yaroslavskyl.a. county supervisor; 57, los angelescounty supervisors have a virtual lifetime tenure and, as the representative of west los angeles, yaroslavsky has the added advantage of being popular in a district that boasts prodigious wealth. critics complain that he hangs back, but when he chooses to exert his force on an issue, it has an impact. supporters of disney hall say the project might never have been completed without his backing. meanwhile, the county has come to rely on him as an important playmaker on the entrenched and politically polarized board of supes. he's also one of the few county officials with national connections and clout.message no: 43235caption: photo: a look at the most powerful people in southern california, drawn from a wide range of arenas: politics, business, the arts, entertainment, media, education, the environment and beyond. we rank the top 10, and then give you the next 90.;
