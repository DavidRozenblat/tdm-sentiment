410271228,Washington Post The,2008-01-30,News,STYLE,Nonprofit organizations,C.5,1045,NEA Teams With Arena Stage to Launch New Plays,"arena  stage has been chosen by the national endowment for the arts to host the federal agency's new play development project. the program will support the development of seven plays at nonprofit theaters around the country, and will offer other theaters a kind of road map of ""best practices"" gleaned from that effort.""for us it is very important . . . that the ultimate beneficiary for this program is a wider group of people and organizations than the limited group that are getting the direct project support,"" said bill o'brien, director of the nea's theater and musical theater division.the winning scripts will be chosen by a panel of theater artists. the two top choices, to be called outstanding new american plays, will receive up to $90,000 each in project support for ""advanced development"" and a full production. five other works with ""strong potential"" will receive up to $20,000 each for ""early stages of development.""arena artistic associate david dower, who will oversee the partnership with the nea, said the company will raise another $230,000 to $250,000 in order to mount a festival of all seven works here, probably in fall 2010, right after arena (fingers crossed) has moved back into its newly renovated home in southwest washington.the nea was very interested, dower said, in finding ""a way for the public to actually see the nea funding in action.""in reviewing arena's application to host the project, o'brien said he was struck ""not so much [by] what we were giving to them but what we were getting back.""dower, now in his second season at arena, has an extensive background in new play development as founding artistic director of z space in san francisco and as a new play development consultant to the andrew w. mellon foundation. he expects the application process for theaters developing new plays to get underway in march and the awardees to be announced in the fall.even while she was back in her native dublin, exiled from living full time in washington due to visa complications between march 2006 and august 2007, solas nua artistic director linda murray kept her hand in. she worked, saved money, kept abreast of new writers in ireland and flew back for short stretches to work with the tiny troupe she founded with producing director dan brick.solas nua, which means ""new light,"" is dedicated to contemporary irish playwrights unknown in the states. if you are a martin mcdonagh or conor mcpherson whose work has been done on broadway, murray says, ""you're done. you don't need my little theater in d.c. anymore.""her latest production is ""trad"" by irish comedian, actor and writer mark doherty. it runs at flashpoint's mead theatre lab till feb. 17.michael john casey and chris davenport play, respectively, a 100-year-old man and his even more ancient da in doherty's spoof of irish stereotypes and traditions. (""trad"" is a slang shortening of ""tradition,"" referring to ""the celtic culture before it was infiltrated"" by the english, murray says.) the two men dodder off in search of the son's 70-year-old love child, bickering and telling tales on the way.""i think it's a wonderful spoof of everything that's considered to be irish and everything that's put onstage as being irish,"" murray says. irish writers working in english, she adds, tend to reflect their native tongue in the way they use ""10 words to say something that could be said in one . . . it kind of conjures up images rather than stating facts, and i think that is inherently within irish people.""ireland is in the midst of a literary golden age, she believes, sparked by the country's new high-tech industry and affluence. ""everything that irish people have ever based their identity on has shifted in the last 10 or 15 years,"" murray says. ""any environment like that is going to make creative people feel the need to comment upon it.""""trad"" is solas nua's 11th production since murray, 31, and brick, 32 and a maryland native, launched the company in 2005. the couple  --  they married in october  --  take no salaries so they can pay guest artists. they've garnered some impressive reviews for such a young company, for shows such as owen mccafferty's ""scenes from the big picture.""that 2007 hit aside, murray says, ""my benchmark is, would i be embarrassed to take this work back to ireland."" if the answer is no, ""i'm happy.""washington stage guild's ann norton hopes the company will be able to move into its space in the new office building at 505 ninth st. nw in the fall. ""i can stand in the box office window already,"" she says. ""it's very exciting.""since losing its temporary home at 14th and t streets nw this year (arena stage, which owns the building, needed it while its southwest campus undergoes renovation), stage guild is presenting a series of readings at flashpoint's mead theatre lab. the next, tuesday at 7:30 p.m., will be hugh whitemore's ""the best of friends,"" a glimpse at the epistolary friendship among george bernard shaw, a dominican abbess and a museum curator. alan wade is directing.future offerings are: shaw's ""don juan in hell"" (feb. 26); ""the rising of the moon"" and ""spreading the news"" (march 2 and 4), comic one-acts about irish life by abbey theatre co-founder lady gregory, penned in the early 20th century; ""widowers' houses"" (march 18), shaw's very first play; ""lord arthur savile's crime"" (march 25), adapted by company member bill largess from an oscar wilde story; ""dangerous corner"" (april 29) by j.b. priestley; and ""the war with the newts"" (may 6), karel capek's sci-fi social satire adapted by emily solomon.after years in low-ceilinged rented spaces, artistic director john macdonald looks forward to doing shows ""that require some more production values."" with the help of an ongoing $6 million capital campaign, he and norton, who are married and have run the literary-minded stage guild on a shoestring since 1986, plan to hire production and box office managers for the new venue.""mom and pop are not going to be running the candy store by themselves anymore,"" macdonald says.",Arena Stage,,1570,0.1922,"['irish', 'murray', 'nea', 'nua', 'trad', 'solas', 'arena', 'dower', 'development', 'artistic', 'production', 'guild', 'stage', 'says', 'shaw', 'ireland', 'theater', 'new', 'march', 'flashpoint', 'theaters', 'doherty', 'spoof', 'mead', 'theatre', 'macdonald', 'project', 'company', 'director', 'play', 'native', 'norton', 'whitemore', 'brien', 'literary', 'dodder', 'adapted', 'plays', 'newts', 'capek', 'abbess', 'lab', 'brick', 'application', 'awardees', 'mccafferty', 'nw', 'southwest', 'fall', 'savile', 'epistolary', 'priestley', 'anymore', 'chosen', 'writers', '000', 'widowers', 'support', 'karel', 'artists', 'feb', 'married', 'ceilinged', 'mcdonagh', '2007', 'abreast', 'office', 'english', 'affluence', 'largess', 'shoestring', 'box', 'washington', 'host', 'receive', 'shortening', 'undergoes', 'infiltrated', 'people', 'conjures', 'conor', 'gleaned', 'slang', 'mcpherson', 'playwrights', 'kept', 'exiled', 'celtic', 'wilde', 'mellon', 'space', 'bickering', 'said', '505', 'abbey', 'work', 'beneficiary', 'penned', 'davenport', 'works', 'shows', 'scripts', 'dublin', 'inherently', 'satire', 'endowment', 'solomon', 'building', 'garnered', 'sci', 'dominican', 'stereotypes', 'owen', 'stating', 'way', 'troupe', 'hugh', 'da', 'benchmark', 'renovated', 'readings', 'visa', 'program', 'till', 'seven', 'kind', 'curator', 'tongue', 'fi', 'embarrassed', 'presenting', 'rented', 'renovation', 'getting', '230', 'complications', 'comedian', 'directing', 'traditions', 'stretches', 'oversee', 'glimpse', 'onstage', 'casey', 'venue', 'candy', 'tales', 'midst', 'salaries', 'reviewing', 'wade', 'offerings', 'bernard', 'lord', 'respectively', 'founding', 'spreading', 'wider', 'underway', 'gregory', 'emily', 'fingers', 'friendship', 'shifted', 'john', 'sparked', 'minded', 'country', '14th', 'stages', 'early', 'moon', 'flew', 'arthur', 'crossed', '1986', 'comic', 'outstanding', '11th', 'spaces', 'group', 'juan', 'need', 'ancient', 'hell', 'ultimate', 'producing', 'unknown', 'exciting', 'extensive', 'partnership', 'best', 'linda', 'oscar', 'saved', 'reviews', 'managers', 'broadway', 'facts', 'year']",0.0172,0.9828,0.2434,0.7566,0.0002,0.998,0.0017,0.004

1022232503,Washington Post The,2012-06-27,Commentary,EDITORIAL-OPINION,Political campaigns,A.17,744,Feeling the Arizona heat,"as the supreme court rules this week on a variety of volatile issues, the question has come up: is barack obama really running against the high court?it might seem so on the surface, especially given the potential fallout, should the justices overturn portions or all of the affordable care act.instead, the justices have caused problems for mitt romney.monday's ruling on arizona's immigration law is a case in point. although the majority ruled against some parts of the law, including a provision that would have made failure to carry registration documents a state misdemeanor, the court left in place other provisions that may raise antipathy toward republicans to new levels.one among them allows state law enforcement officers to determine whether someone they stop, detain or arrest for some other reason is in the country legally. the obvious concern is that enforcement would lead to racial profiling. and of course it will because we can be pretty certain that caucasians pulled over for, say, speeding won't be required to produce proof of citizenship.unless, that is, state officials realize that treating everyone equally is the only way to avoid charges of racial profiling. arizona gov. jan brewer (r) has promised that mechanisms are in place to ensure that hispanics are not singled out.what those mechanisms might be isn't clear, but one can imagine at least one possible scenario - a reiteration of the sort of willy-nilly, random granny-search ops we've witnessed since 9/11.taking a stroll through probability, let's say that officer smith pulls over paco ramirez and asks for proof of citizenship, and it turns out that paco is descended from three generations ofu.s.-born, tax-paying ramirezes. paco is probably going to be annoyed. he may be sufficiently annoyed to file a profiling (or harassment) complaint with the courts. after all, why, except that he looked hispanic, would the officer have asked for his papers?moreover, how likely is it that hispanic-looking folks will be pulled over for ""suspicious behavior"" for the sole purpose of checking those papers?the only way to avoid such charges, of course, is to also pull over karen miller and insist that she produce proof of citizenship. this is what random airport checks are all about. officers can't pull out muhammad bin laden even if he's sweating profusely and chanting ""allahu akbar"" unless they also pull over betty white.what we have here is a sticky wicket.and no one is in greater need of goo gone than mitt romney, who has said that arizona's law is a model for the rest of the nation. not only has that law been deemed at least partly unconstitutional, but romney is now positioned to be associated with profiling. not the best way to court the hispanic vote. worse, if arizona and other similarly minded states begin to apply the equal-treatment template across races and ethnicities, he'll have everybody mad at him.not that the arizona law is his fault, obviously. but angry people will pick the easiest target, and the obama campaign will make sure those dots are connected. one thing is for certain: romney can't change his mind. he's stuck with a position that, though appealing to arizonans and others who are justifiably angry with our inert (inept) federal government, is profoundly offensive to our american sense of fairness. we simply don't single out groups of people in this country for special scrutiny. what is expedient or even logical isn't always ethical, and better that we err on the side of the latter standard.one may argue that any smallish inconvenience is an acceptable price to pay in exchange for law and order. in fact, many americans don't mind airport searches or even x-ray examinations of their nethers. but the fact is, these security measures are unprecedented intrusions into our personal spaces - inarguably violations of our civil rights.thus, today's bargain is an exchange of freedom for greater security, and the question is whether it's worth it. if you're not here illegally, you might feel the trade-off is acceptable. but if you are citizen paco ramirez or one of the tens of millions of americans of hispanic descent, you might think something else. you might think you live in a police state, that your civil rights are in jeopardy, and that your family is under siege.and you might not be inclined to vote republican.",Republican Party,"Romney, W Mitt",1380,0.2144,"['paco', 'profiling', 'romney', 'hispanic', 'arizona', 'law', 'citizenship', 'proof', 'mechanisms', 'annoyed', 'ofu', 'nethers', 'pull', 'ramirezes', 'mitt', 'court', 'justices', 'ramirez', 'acceptable', 'random', 'papers', 'wicket', 'reiteration', 'racial', 'allahu', 'inarguably', 'angry', 'caucasians', 'arizonans', 'state', 'airport', 'nilly', 'produce', 'enforcement', 'expedient', 'unless', 'smallish', 'pulled', 'profusely', 'inert', 'obama', 'intrusions', 'exchange', 'justifiably', 'greater', 'ethnicities', 'antipathy', 'akbar', 'officers', 'goo', 'granny', 'civil', 'err', 'avoid', 'charges', 'examinations', 'vote', 'detain', 'inept', 'officer', 'certain', 'willy', 'rights', 'template', 'mind', 'sweating', 'inconvenience', 'probability', 'ops', 'americans', 'dots', 'hispanics', 'security', 'brewer', 'sticky', 'chanting', 'question', 'sufficiently', 'isn', 'profoundly', 'stroll', 'fact', 'descended', 'easiest', 'siege', 'course', 'way', 'jeopardy', 'descent', 'logical', 'unconstitutional', 'fairness', 'speeding', 'overturn', 'inclined', 'muhammad', 'searches', 'misdemeanor', 'positioned', 'fallout', 'ethical', 'pulls', 'portions', 'volatile', 'betty', 'witnessed', 'singled', 'suspicious', 'bargain', 'harassment', 'bin', 'sole', 'provisions', 'provision', 'treating', 'laden', 'insist', 'deemed', 'illegally', 'scenario', 'fault', 'registration', 'checking', 'minded', 'country', 'legally', 'appealing', 'mad', 'unprecedented', 'spaces', 'similarly', 'place', 'scrutiny', 'citizen', 'violations', 'generations', 'complaint', 'karen', 'affordable', 'barack', 'tens', 'checks', 'equally', 'asks', 'immigration', 'races', 'partly', 'surface', 'equal', 'think', 'connected', 'folks', 'courts', 'stuck', 'argue', 'purpose', 'ray', 'apply', 'obvious', 'arrest', 'say', 'ruling', 'ruled', 'promised', 'realize', 'miller', 'file', 'documents', 'imagine', 'freedom', 'failure', 'obviously', 'behavior', 'measures', 'variety', 'supreme', 'ensure', 'don', 'allows', 'determine', 'offensive', 'target', 'levels', 'model', 'worse', 'treatment', 'turns', 'carry', 'paying', 'republicans', 'standard', 'search', 'caused', 'concern', 'sort', 'everybody', 'gov', 'millions', 'raise', 'parts']",0.0015,0.9985,0.9123,0.0877,0.0032,0.8867,0.1101,0.3843

""it's a transparent run-and-hide strategy by mr. kilgore.""d'amore said the fact that his candidate is on the ballot  --  with more than 24,000 signatures from registered voters in virginia  --  should be enough to prove that he is a legitimate contender.a recent survey of 625 likely voters by mason-dixon polling & research showed potts receiving 9 percent of the vote; kaine got 38 percent and kilgore 37 percent. the poll also found that that 58 percent of respondents wanted to see potts included in the debate.kilgore has maintained that he would not participate in a debate that includes potts, a republican state senator from winchester, because he does not believe potts has a chance of winning the election. kaine has agreed to debate potts, who is running as an independent, and the two have a confirmed appearance scheduled for sept. 30.tim murtaugh, press secretary for the kilgore campaign, said that the decision to debate potts under certain conditions was consistent with kilgore's belief that such forums should be limited to those candidates who have made a significant showing among the state's likely voters.""we have said all along that we would only debate candidates who have a chance of winning,"" murtaugh said. ""if the debate organizers set that bar at 15 percent, then we're willing to accept that.""kaine's campaign said that kilgore was responding to the will of the people in agreeing to the third debate.

""it's good to see mr. kilgore come around.""potts could be a threat to both major-party candidates. the mason dixon poll found that much of his support comes from republicans, though his positions on gay rights and abortion rights might attract some democratic voters as he becomes better known.""his campaign has hurt both of them, although potts clearly has centered his criticisms on kilgore,"" sabato said.

1442899918,Washington Post The,2013-10-19,News,A-SECTION,Expansion,A.8,623,Mexico a driving force in auto manufacturing,"mexico takes the wheelin auto manufacturingstarting in the 1980s, the u.s. auto industry went through a major upheaval. automakers and suppliers began opening more and more plants in the south, taking advantage of the region's weaker unions and lower labor costs. that, in turn, undercut the historically dominant position of detroit and the midwest.now, half a century later, the u.s. auto industry is going through yet another major churn. and this time around, mexico is the driving force.that's one upshot of an intriguing new report on the auto industry from the brookings institution. the report is ostensibly a case study focused on tennessee's automotive sector, but it also offers a glimpse into the way the entire north american auto industry has shifted over the past 20 years.the big story here is mexico, which has massively expanded its share of north american auto manufacturing since the north american free trade agreement in 1994. automakers from general motors to nissan have been opening plants south of the border, attracted by mexico's low wages and dense industrial clusters.last year, mexico produced more than 3 million vehicles, compared with 10.8 million in the united states. automotive plants in mexico assemble everything from gm silverado pickups to chrysler engines. nissan, mazda and audi are all building plants in mexico, and jobs have followed.since 2000, overall auto industry employment in north america has fallen from 2 million to 1.5 million - partly because more and more positions have been automated. but mexico actually added jobs in that time, going from 554,000 to 579,000. today, nearly 40 percent of auto jobs on the continent are in mexico.and that trend is expected to continue. ""over the next decade, the u.s. share of auto employment is likely to drift down below 50 percent,"" says mark muro, one of the co-authors of the brookings report.what's the significance of this? for starters, it means that the south's position in the auto industry is no longer quite so secure. in the 1980s, foreign automakers such as toyota, bmw and hyundai set up factories in tennessee, kentucky and alabama to take advantage of lower labor costs, weaker union rules and state tax incentives. tennessee's economy was utterly transformed when nissan located its first plant in smyrna 30 years ago.but the south's cost advantage over the midwest is narrowing - and no u.s. state can compete with mexico on labor costs alone.""that completely changes the competitive challenge,"" muro said. ""no longer will southern states be able to win on cost alone. they'll have to find some other way to compete.""that includes technological innovation and making their supply chains more nimble to reduce costs. the brookings report notes that in tennessee - one of the few states that has been resilient in the face of mexico's rise - nearly 78 percent of the jobs are in the supply chain, building the parts, chassis or electronics rather than manufacturing the actual vehicles.in an interesting twist, muro suspects that michigan and the rest of the midwest might be fairly well-positioned here, in part because the region has been forced to compete against low-cost suppliers for many years now.""their labor costs have been coming down, but they also have very dense supply chains and can get more efficiencies and cluster benefits there,"" muro said. ""and michigan still has its technology centers.""still, the overall trends are striking. even as the auto industry is rebounding from the recession, the number of jobs across north america keeps shrinking, as automation improves and the robots take over. meanwhile, mexico is quickly establishing its dominance on the continent.- brad plumer",,,1380,0.224,"['auto', 'mexico', 'muro', 'industry', 'brookings', 'tennessee', 'nissan', 'plants', 'automakers', 'jobs', 'costs', 'labor', 'midwest', 'north', 'compete', 'supply', 'weaker', 'automotive', 'suppliers', 'advantage', 'wheelin', 'south', 'continent', 'dense', 'report', 'chains', 'manufacturing', 'plumer', 'employment', 'million', 'cost', '1980s', 'vehicles', 'smyrna', 'percent', 'michigan', 'states', 'silverado', 'chassis', 'massively', 'efficiencies', 'overall', 'upshot', '579', 'mazda', 'region', 'automation', '554', 'audi', 'american', 'churn', 'lower', 'hyundai', 'narrowing', 'opening', 'robots', 'pickups', 'nimble', 'position', 'share', 'clusters', 'longer', 'ostensibly', 'upheaval', 'drift', 'improves', 'bmw', 'resilient', 'undercut', 'automated', 'low', 'building', 'assemble', 'cluster', 'rebounding', 'chrysler', 'america', 'utterly', 'shrinking', 'dominance', 'technological', 'positioned', 'factories', 'engines', 'toyota', 'nearly', 'major', 'intriguing', 'establishing', 'glimpse', 'significance', 'gm', 'electronics', 'motors', 'innovation', 'incentives', 'years', 'wages', 'transformed', 'twist', 'authors', 'shifted', 'unions', 'historically', 'trends', 'dominant', 'attracted', 'starters', 'suspects', 'recession', 'alabama', 'kentucky', 'brad', 'located', 'institution', 'sector', 'fairly', '78', 'partly', 'striking', 'fallen', 'expanded', 'actual', 'trend', '000', 'secure', 'industrial', 'plant', 'positions', 'competitive', 'state', 'chain', 'detroit', 'going', 'keeps', 'border', 'interesting', '1994', 'centers', 'completely', 'notes', 'way', 'reduce', 'benefits', 'produced', 'focused', 'agreement', 'driving', 'compared', 'rise', 'parts', 'offers', '2000', 'tax', 'decade', 'technology', 'foreign', 'entire', 'challenge', 'economy', 'quite', 'forced', 'rules', 'study', 'followed', 'century', 'trade', 'union', 'changes', 'southern', 'quickly', 'actually', 'includes', 'rest', 'means', 'force', 'time', 'takes', 'continue', 'mark', 'turn', 'likely', '40', 'coming', 'able', 'face', 'expected', 'taking', 'story', 'general', 'win', 'added', 'began', '50', 'number', 'll', 'case', 'free', 'went', 'united']",0.001,0.999,0.45,0.55,0.0005,0.9984,0.0012,0.0012

(fidel last made an appearance in 2000.)there wasn't so much as a drop-by from sudanese president omar hassan al-bashir. that's probably because he faces international war crimes charges, accused of orchestrating a campaign of murder, torture and forced expulsions in darfur, and would probably be arrested on the spot.speaking of the united nations, equatorial guinea's foreign minister used the general assembly meeting to call on the u.n. educational, scientific and cultural organization (unesco) to stop stalling and start giving out the life sciences award set up in the name of that country's dictator, teodoro obiang nguema.loop fans may recall that the award, endowed for five years by a $3 million gift from obiang, was set up two years ago - over objections by washington and the european union - and then stalled over outrage from the human rights community.the issue popped up again in june as obiang, in power for 31 years, accused opponents who were trying to block the prize of being ""colonialist, discriminatory, racist and prejudiced.""but archbishop emeritus desmond tutu of south africa told unesco, ""a beacon for hope and development,"" not to allow ""itself to burnish the unsavory reputation of a dictator"" whose regime ""has been marked by corruption and abuse.""unesco's executive board agreed to study the matter further, deferring the question again. hard to imagine unesco would destroy once and for all its reputation for a lousy $3 million.so, what's with all that digging on west executive drive between the west wing and the eisenhower executive office building? the drilling and pounding, which started in may, are driving folks in nearby offices to distraction. a new bunker in the works?not so, says the general services administration. the official response: ""the construction [is] to replace aged and service-interruption-prone heating, cooling, electrical, fire alarm equipment and systems serving the west wing.""the gsa says it's ""constantly working to mitigate as much as possible any impact on the day to day work at the white house."" sounded like the end of the world a couple of days ago.when will this end - and, more important for some, when will the parking perks on the drive be restored? ah, well, ""looks like it will be more than a year,"" we were told.private sector, anyone?the agency for international development, supposedly running the third prong of the obama foreign policy of defense, diplomacy and development, didn't have an administrator for the first year of the administration - despite all the earnest talk about elevating the importance of development.after administrator rajiv shah was sworn in to run the place, his picture joined those of obama, vice president biden and secretary of state hillary rodham clinton on the wall in the agency lobby.but shah's photo recently disappeared. aid folks, prone to machiavellian thinking, wondered whether this was a sign, a la the soviets erasing photos of trotsky.""maybe they're trying to send a message that he's no higher than a deputy secretary so why should his picture hang there?"" one employee speculated.not really. seems the problem is that you can't drill into metal wall, so the pictures are hung with velcro, and sometimes they fall down. ""part of elevating development will involve upgrading to industrial-strength velcro,"" said spokeswoman lynne weil. a visit to home depot appears to be in order.as expected, morgan stanley executive tom nides, formerly at credit suisse first boston, fannie mae and the bill clinton-era u.s. trade rep's office, has been nominated as deputy secretary of state for management and resources. he would replace jack lew, whose nomination to run the office of management and budget has been held by sen. mary landrieu (d-la.) to protest the gulf oil-drilling moratorium.michael vickers, now assistant secretary of defense for special operations/low-intensity conflict and interdependent capabilities (solic&ic), has been picked to move up to undersecretary for intelligence.",United Nations--UN,,1450,0.2122,"['obiang', 'unesco', 'bolton', 'development', 'velcro', 'sarkozy', 'secretary', 'elevating', 'shah', 'appearance', 'building', 'drilling', 'dictator', 'executive', 'obama', 'chavez', 'solic', 'president', 'prone', 'bush', 'loop', 'nguema', 'nides', 'administrator', 'lamely', 'gabfest', 'ravings', 'trotsky', 'ic', 'assembly', 'teodoro', 'colonialist', 'folks', 'wing', 'reputation', 'incoherence', 'prong', 'years', 'west', 'interdependent', 'general', 'collapsible', 'machiavellian', 'replace', 'bruni', 'gaddafi', 'equatorial', 'nations', 'gsa', 'award', 'deputy', 'rajiv', 'fondest', 'expulsions', 'united', 'hilarity', 'prejudiced', 'office', 'landrieu', 'vickers', 'tutu', 'clinton', 'la', 'picture', 'burnish', 'deferring', 'didn', 'colonialism', 'sulfur', 'accused', 'moammar', 'reparations', 'unsavory', 'bashir', 'ahmadinejad', 'endowed', '65th', 'management', 'foreign', 'weil', 'sudanese', 'orchestrating', 'soviets', 'darfur', 'interruption', 'stalling', 'lew', 'bodyguard', 'wall', 'erasing', 'ditto', 'suisse', 'stale', 'undersecretary', 'maybe', 'gutted', 'venezuelan', 'fidel', 'cameo', 'guinea', 'whipping', 'wacky', 'upgrading', 'discriminatory', 'shattering', 'drive', 'agency', 'archbishop', 'carla', 'desmond', 'lynne', 'meeting', 'fannie', 'mitigate', 'defense', 'lousy', 'week', 'moratorium', 'emeritus', 'bunker', 'administration', 'mahmoud', 'beacon', 'splitting', 'orchestrated', 'hassan', 'speculated', 'ah', 'eisenhower', 'hugo', 'libya', 'nicolas', 'international', 'probably', 'pounding', 'perks', 'dazzling', 'perennial', 'venezuela', 'cooling', 'mae', 'distraction', 'diplomacy', 'castro', 'depot', 'capabilities', 'digging', 'rodham', 'popped', 'drill', 'omar', 'mailed', 'heating', 'predictable', 'sworn', 'virgin', 'torture', 'earnest', 'tent', 'famously', 'objections', 'supposedly', 'renovation', 'completion', 'devil', 'trying', 'stalled', 'sciences', 'smell', 'racist', 'outrage', 'electrical', 'alarm', 'aged', 'start', 'trillion', 'shell', 'entertaining', 'slam', 'blown', 'restored', 'colleague', 'destroy', 'excitement', 'floors', 'spectacular', 'intensity', 'diplomatic', 'disappeared', 'wondered', 'nominated', 'stunning', 'regime', 'highlight', 'run', 'lobby', 'sounded', 'feared', 'hung', 'involve']",0.9998,0.0002,0.6598,0.3402,0.9984,0.0013,0.0002,0.5001
410138563,Washington Post The,2007-07-26,Commentary,EDITORIAL,Fuel economy standards,A.20,594,Leadership Needed; Higher fuel economy standards may be doomed without Nancy Pelosi's support.,"there is a pitched battle underway in the house of representatives over whether to introduce an amendment to increase the corporate average fuel economy (cafe) standard in the energy package due to hit the floor before congress takes off for its august recess. while one camp is eager to follow the senate's aggressive boost in cafe requirements for the first time since 1975, another advocates tapping the brakes.  leadership from speaker nancy pelosi (d-calif.) could help resolve this fight. but she has been loath to exert it publicly.when the senate passed its energy bill in june, it raised cafe standards, which rest around 25 miles per gallon today, to an average of 35 mpg for all cars, light trucks and sport-utility vehicles by 2020. yet an initial attempt to address fuel economy in the house was scuttled by powerful energy committee chairman john d. dingell (d-mich.). he wants to address the issue in the climate change legislation he plans to introduce this fall. environmental advocates rightly worry that such a punt means a boost in cafe standards won't happen. but one must. the transportation sector accounts for a third of u.s. carbon dioxide emissions, a major contributor to global warming. even the national petroleum council,  charged by president bush to study the nation's energy sector, urged in a report released last week that the fuel economy of cars and light trucks be improved ""at the maximum rate possible.""the bill from rep. edward j. markey (d-mass.) has 150 sponsors and would go a long way toward achieving that.  it would require a boost in cafe standards for both cars and light trucks to an average of 35 mpg by 2018. but a rival bill from rep. baron p. hill (d-ind.) and rep. lee terry (r-neb.) that has 103 sponsors, including mr. dingell, would proceed more slowly by creating separate standards for cars and trucks and allowing the government to set a standard for cars of not less than an average of 32 miles per gallon but not more than 35 miles per gallon by 2022. in addition, the bill attempts to undermine california's tough new air pollution laws by getting the transportation department, which deals with fuel economy, into the business of regulating carbon emissions, which the supreme court ruled in the spring is within the purview of the environmental protection agency. an all-republican bill from rep. joe l. barton (r-tex.) and more than two dozen other sponsors seeks to slow things down even further by proposing a fuel efficiency average of 35 mpg for cars and 27.5 mpg for light trucks by 2022.ms. pelosi is already on record supporting higher cafe standards for cars and light trucks. considering that mr. markey is a close ally of ms. pelosi, it is not difficult to imagine her backing his  bill. but she has yet to commit to allowing it  --  or any other cafe legislation  --  to be offered as an amendment when the energy bill comes to the floor. it is vitally important that the house pass its own cafe legislation. to hope and pray that the senate version survives the conference process, during which mr. dingell will assuredly have a role, is a bad strategy. so is putting off action until mr. dingell's climate change legislation is introduced.  the momentum is there for strong cafe standards. a public nod from ms. pelosi could be all mr. markey needs to get his amendment the support it requires to pass.",House of Representatives,"Pelosi, Nancy",1530,0.2226,"['cafe', 'dingell', 'mpg', 'trucks', 'cars', 'standards', 'pelosi', 'markey', 'fuel', 'energy', 'light', 'rep', 'gallon',

""no letups!"" he yelled underneath the stands in the arena corridor. ""no letups! we got a whole 'nother half.""this whole father-son nostalgia the university has been selling for almost two years had been more hope than reality entering yesterday afternoon, with more excitement coming from recruiting commitments than on-court results. but if john thompson iii has not yet completely refurbished the program his father willed into a national powerhouse, he got much closer in two of the most scintillating hours of basketball georgetown has ever played at mci center.as good as georgetown's future looked, yesterday felt like old- home week. oblivious to what had happened to his alma mater yesterday, dikembe mutombo got off a plane in detroit, where his houston rockets will face the pistons today.""georgetown beat duke?"" mutombo said in that rich, baritone cookie monster voice of his.""you mean men or women?""""no?"" deek said.""wow, they now have some very good players.""very smart, too.it is not often that duke is taught how to play by another team. yet georgetown tutored the blue devils for more than a half, spreading the court, drawing many of college basketball's best on- the-ball defenders to the perimeter before beating them to the goal. jeff green, georgetown's sophomore forward, completely outplayed duke senior all-american shelden williams, who finished with four points in 34 minutes.duke was defensively delirious, caught napping as the hoyas ran backdoor cut after backdoor cut. there was a reason it looked like princeton vs. ucla, circa 1996, when the defending national champs were stunned by a bunch of overachieving ivy leaguers cutting hard to the basket and making the most of every offensive possession in the first round of the ncaa tournament; thompson iii transplanted the princeton offense to his father's old campus.yesterday, the hoyas were a bunch of overachieving, smart big easters. they went to the floor. they withstood 41 points from the indefatigable j.j. redick.redick hit some absolutely unbelievable layups, using the hoyas as traffic cones on his way toward the rim. he made six three- pointers. but he was all duke had yesterday.""bowman, owens and green, those were all big-time players,"" mike krzyzewski said afterward. when was the last time the most accomplished coach in the college game said that about georgetown ballplayers?he also made an important distinction: ""it wasn't their offense as much as the unity of their offense,"" coach k said.essentially, five playing as one knocked off six mcdonald's all- americans.this win was a much more notable feat than the 1985 win, because the hoyas were no. 2 when they beat chris mullin and walter berry's st. john's team. these hoyas came in unranked. they had lost to every ranked team they had played. in fact, duke was more responsible for filling the building than was georgetown.but this was an afternoon when the hoyas' past and present fused together, and it felt right. on several t-shirts, sandwiched between the words ""some have forgotten"" and ""we will remind them"" was an unusually large roman numeral iii.before tip-off, big john was told his son's team would win if they played the perfect game.""they have to play better than perfect,"" he said.afterward, he smiled. ""they did, didn't they,"" he said.meanwhile, mutombo was asking for details of his alma mater.""this is good, exciting news for me,"" he said. ""i can't wait to call big john.""""oh, did i tell you?"" mutombo added, ""my youngest son will be there in two years. he's a junior now.""so there will be a ewing and mutombo at georgetown at the same time, coached by a thompson?""yes,"" mutombo said.more nostalgia at georgetown.perfect. no, better than perfect.",Georgetown University,,1210,0.2244,"['georgetown', 'mutombo', 'hoyas', 'duke', 'letups', 'yesterday', 'ewing', 'bowman', 'thompson', 'alma', 'mater', 'overachieving', 'redick', 'backdoor', 'perfect', 'iii', 'said', 'father', 'team', 'offense', 'owens', 'nostalgia', 'deek', 'basketball', 'princeton', 'john', 'forgotten', '1985', 'nother', 'easters', 'son', 'bunch', 'big', 'ncaa', 'afterward', 'coach', 'shelden', 'numeral', 'college', 'played', 'smart', 'win', 'completely', 'darrel', 'tournament', 'gangly', 'bobbed', 'dikembe', 'pandemonium', 'midcourt', 'tutored', 'indefatigable', 'scintillating', 'napping', 'cradled', 'mullin', 'delirious', 'unranked', 'ballplayers', 'game', 'voice', 'hoya', 'fused', 'afternoon', 'unfathomable', 'got', 'blared', 'krzyzewski', 'wigs', 'outplayed', 'chests', 'cones', 'willed', 'rafters', 'withstood', 'maddening', 'transplanted', 'looked', 'ball', 'blue', 'layups', 'moot', 'sandwiched', 'beat', 'leaguers', 'brethren', 'refurbished', 'green', 'named', 'poking', 'metallic', 'afro', 'oblivious', 'frenzied', 'felt', 'chant', 'circa', 'mci', 'baritone', 'champs', 'good', 'time', 'toppled', 'cut', 'wasn', 'pistons', 'players', 'points', 'stormed', 'future', 'famer', 'clutch', 'cookie', 'defensively', 'perimeter', 'powerhouse', 'dunk', 'rim', 'ivy', 'yelled', 'berry', 'devils', 'program', 'undefeated', 'court', 'feat', 'corridor', 'smiled', 'commitments', 'unbelievable', 'underneath', 'lost', 'distinction', 'rockets', 'spray', 'horn', 'inability', 'wow', 'pointers', 'unity', 'unusually', 'monster', 'recruit', 'half', 'defenders', 'coached', 'stunned', 'like', 'recruiting', 'spreading', 'excitement', 'remind', 'mcdonald', 'fingers', 'youngest', 'notable', 'basket', 'transferred', 'bulls', 'play', 'season', 'shirts', 'roman', 'better', 'accomplished', 'filling', 'halftime', 'celebrating', 'struggles', 'knocked', 'brandon', '87', 'tip', 'painted', '84', 'ucla', 'exciting', 'sophomore', 'walter', 'possession', 'index', 'national', 'wore', 'eligible', 'indiana', 'arena', 'plane', 'essentially', 'taught', 'beating', 'defending', 'entering', 'old', 'campus', 'absolutely', 'upset', 'vs', 'jump', 'fly', 'detroit']",0.0542,0.9458,0.3642,0.6358,0.0009,0.9961,0.003,0.0603

1678440923,Washington Post The,2015-05-05,General Information,HEALTH,Salt,E.1,1617,Pass the salt,"salt intake that is often deemed high may actually have benefits, scientists say.""we humans eat more salt than is necessary. but we all do it. so the question is: why?"" asks paul breslin, a professor of nutritional sciences who researches sodium appetite at new jersey's rutgers university.in the past, people thought that salt boosted health - so much so that the latin word for ""health"" - ""salus"" - was derived from ""sal"" (salt). in medieval times, salt was prescribed to treat a multitude of conditions, including toothaches, stomachaches and ""heaviness of mind.""while governments have long pushed people to reduce their intakes of sodium chloride (table salt) to prevent high blood pressure, stroke and coronary heart disease, there are good reasons why cutting down on salt is not an easy thing to do.scientists suggest that sodium intake may have physiological benefits that make salt particularly tempting - and ditching the salt shaker difficult. it comes down to evolution.""in biology, if something is attractive and we invest in gaining it, it must be beneficial, adaptive in evolutionary terms,"" says micah leshem, a professor of psychology at haifa university in israel, who spent decades researching salt's unique appeal.people tend to consume about the same amount of sodium no matter where they live, and this amount hasn't changed much in decades. those facts hint at the biological basis of our sodium appetite.a 2014 analysis of data that spanned 50 years and dozens of countries (including the united states, france, china and several african nations, including zimbabwe and south africa) found that the quantity of sodium that most people consume (and then excrete) falls into a historically narrow range of 2.6 to 4.8 grams per day. (and then there are extremes: in 16th-century sweden, for example, people ate 100 grams a day, mostly from fish that had been salted to preserve it.)""over the last five decades, salt content of commercial food in our food [in the united states] has gone up. but if you look at people's 24-hour urinary sodium excretion, you see that the amounts of salt people consume have been constant,"" he says. irrespective of age, sex or race, between 1957 and 2003 americans have been eating on average 3.5 grams of salt a day. ""this suggests that we are somehow regulating the amount of salt we are eating,"" breslin says.and, in fact, salt is good for us. sodium is necessary for preventing dehydration, for proper transmission of nerve impulses and for normal functioning of cells. if we ate no sodium at all, we would die. when they become sodium-deficient, many animals go out of their way to find the mineral. that's why, for example, sweaty clothes of alpinists tend to attract mountain goats.sodium depletion can develop after severe sweating, diarrhea or vomiting or, if you are a lab rat, after it is induced by a scientist. pharmacology professor alan kim johnson and colleagues from the university of iowa gave rats diuretics and found that sodium-depleted rodents acquired a strong attraction for salted chips. in other experiments, sodium-deficient animals hungrily drank ultra-salty solutions that they would otherwise find disgusting.lifetime cravingsonce sodium deficiency is experienced, salt cravings can last a lifetime. that happens with humans, too - but only if the deficiency strikes in very early childhood, or even before birth.if your mother suffered frequent vomiting in pregnancy or if you lost significant amounts of sodium as a baby (due to vomiting or diarrhea, for example), chances are good that you eat more salt than other people do, even by as much as 50 percent, as one of leshem's studies has shown. this is probably because sodium depletion alters our central nervous system so that we develop long-lasting preference for the mineral, johnson says.in one of leshem's studies, babies who had low concentrations of sodium in their blood in the first weeks of their lives grew up to be teenagers with a penchant for salt, even salt that is seemingly hidden in processed foods. ""even if you can't taste the salt, apparently your body does. it's working on an unconscious level to condition a preference for sodium,"" leshem explains.this makes sense from an evolutionary perspective, says daniel fessler, a ucla anthropologist: if a mother or her infant experiences sodium hunger, it could mean that salt is hard to come by in their environment - and so it is better to be on a constant lookout for it. that is also how humans may have evolved their general liking of salt, johnson says: ""mankind spent a lot of evolutionary history on the hot african savanna where salt was very scarce and readily lost from the body. since severe sodium depletion can cause circulatory collapse, there was a selection for mechanisms to save sodium and to drive us to consume more of it.""a calming effect?eating salt may also help calm us, or reduce our stress. in animal studies, the effects are pretty clear. an experiment published in 1995 showed, for example, that when rats are put in stressful situations, they choose to drink salty water rather than unsalted water. in another study, when wild rabbits were stressed, their sodium intake shot up.the possibly stress-reducing, or mood-enhancing, effects of salt in humans are not as well documented, but there is some evidence. in a 2014 study involving about 10,000 americans, leshem and his colleagues found a relationship between salt intake and depression: women whose diets were high in sodium were less depressed than other women. ""maybe people are self-medicating with salt,"" he reasons. ""but that's a small effect; salt is not going to cure anyone of depression.""breslin believes there may be another evolution-based reason why we love salt: ""salt accelerates sexual maturation in animal models, resulting in more offspring,"" he says. male rats on high-sodium diets, for example, have increased sperm counts. and in a 1991 experiment, men whose sodium intake was lowered to 2.4 grams a day complained of erectile dysfunction more often than those who consumed three grams a day. ""the most problematic was a combination of a diuretic and a low-sodium diet,"" says epidemiologist sylvia wassertheil-smoller, the study's lead author.what's more, women from the yanomami tribe in brazil, famed for their low salt intake (23 milligrams per day - less than 1 percent of what the average american consumes), have fewer children than could be expected, and they often miscarry. yet according to tilman drueke, a nephrologist who researches fertility and sodium intake at the french institute of health and medical research, this observation should be taken ""with a grain of salt"" because, he says, ""the relatively low fertility and high rate of pregnancy loss in yanomami women clearly cannot be attributed to their very low salt intake alone. this is only one hypothesis among several others, including the higher prevalence of infectious diseases.""it's also possible that sodium aids growth. as scientists from new jersey medical school found out, if you put rats on low-salt diets, their bones and muscles fail to grow as fast as they normally would. in one of his experiments, leshem found that children in general reach for more salt than adults do - independent of calorie intake - which may be explained by the needs of their growing bodies.finally, there are a few diseases that can turn a few of us into salt gluttons. about 15 percent of people with adrenal insufficiency (addison's disease) - which can cause weakness, anemia and low blood pressure - experience acute salt cravings. hiding saltshakers from them may not be a good idea.in 1940 the case of a little boy was described in the journal of the american medical association. from the time he was a year old, the boy would go out of his way to eat massive amounts of salt. when he started speaking, one of his first words was ""salt."" during a hospital stay (unrelated to his dietary habits), he was put on a low-sodium diet. to prevent him from sneaking around the hospital and stealing salt, he was strapped to his bed. he soon died. the reason? due to severe and undiagnosed cortico-adrenal insufficiency, his kidneys were unable to retain sodium. only eating huge amounts of salt had kept the boy alive.salt sensitivityyet most of us do not need huge amounts of salt to survive. just the opposite: about half of humans are what is called salt-sensitive: if they consume lots of sodium, their blood pressure will go up. but if we do have internal regulatory mechanisms that tell us to load up on salt when our bodies need it (for growth, for mood improvement or to simply prevent dehydration), does it even make sense to encourage people to try to reduce their dietary sodium? it does, breslin says, but only to a point.""if people are regulating their sodium intakes, they are not going to be able to reduce it a lot - say, by 50 percent or more. it would be like putting someone in a room and cutting the amount of oxygen by half: your body will try to maintain the level of oxygen in your blood and will make you breathe faster."" and so, as johnson suggests, when it comes to salt intake, ""moderation is probably ideal.""cut your sodium intake if your health condition requires it and your doctor recommends it, but don't look at salt as an evil that should be banned from your plate completely: there may be valid reasons why your body craves it.zaraska is a writer based in france.",,,1480,0.2235,"['salt', 'sodium', 'intake', 'leshem', 'grams', 'breslin', 'consume', 'rats', 'humans', 'says', 'depletion', 'low', 'amounts', 'yanomami', 'people', 'evolutionary', 'vomiting', 'diets', 'blood', 'insufficiency', 'adrenal', 'eating', 'intakes', 'example', 'reduce', 'cravings', 'researches', 'johnson', 'deficient', 'deficiency', 'dehydration', 'salted', 'diarrhea', 'body', 'scientists', 'fertility', 'severe', 'mechanisms', 'mineral', 'regulating', 'salty', 'eat', 'dietary', 'zaraska', 'day', 'studies', 'women', 'health', 'experiments', 'saltshakers', 'prevent', 'preference', 'oxygen', 'reasons', 'boy', 'appetite', 'drueke', 'percent', 'alpinists', 'pregnancy', 'ate', 'professor', 'evolution', 'high', 'salus', 'diseases', 'excretion', 'diet', 'study', 'pressure', 'toothaches', 'experiment', 'smoller', 'decades', 'medical', 'miscarry', 'gluttons', 'fessler', 'excrete', 'depression', 'tilman', 'nephrologist', 'stomachaches', 'mood', 'lifetime', 'diuretics', 'constant', 'stress', 'hungrily', 'diuretic', 'bodies', 'animals', 'animal', 'medicating', 'tend', 'including', 'pharmacology', 'colleagues', 'good', 'heaviness', 'circulatory', 'effects', 'suggests', 'erectile', 'university', '50', 'cutting', '2014', 'develop', 'disease', 'jersey', 'france', 'chloride', 'irrespective', 'undiagnosed', 'african', 'haifa', 'savanna', 'urinary', 'condition', 'benefits', 'maturation', 'necessary', 'does', 'craves', 'accelerates', 'physiological', 'ditching', 'anemia', 'alters', 'adaptive', 'milligrams', 'growth', 'coronary', 'hypothesis', 'kidneys', 'consumes', 'sperm', 'unsalted', 'shaker', 'cause', 'sal', 'effect', 'hospital', 'anthropologist', 'micah', 'rabbits', 'huge', 'rodents', 'sneaking', 'calorie', 'goats', 'prevalence', 'zimbabwe', 'mankind', 'epidemiologist', 'spanned', 'concentrations', 'multitude', 'moderation', 'calming', 'impulses', 'sweaty', 'sweating', 'liking', 'disgusting', 'average', 'nutritional', 'water', 'reason', 'lookout', 'americans', 'dysfunction', 'offspring', 'food', 'sense', 'extremes', 'quantity', 'depleted', 'spent', 'drank', 'tempting', 'penchant', 'level', 'sylvia', 'rat', 'mother', 'induced', 'researching', 'prescribed', 'unconscious', 'addison', 'stressful', 'derived', 'medieval', 'probably', '1940', 'enhancing', 'tribe', 'biology']",0.1006,0.8994,0.6911,0.3089,0.7294,0.2674,0.0032,0.0486

bag them and trash them as you work the lawn this fall. here are some common weeds and how to tackle them.ucrabgrass is an annual that will be killed by the frost. it perpetuates itself by seed, now dispersed and waiting to sprout next may and june.hand-pull old plants as part of the soil preparation for seeding. don't apply a pre- or post-emergent crabgrass herbicide now, which will inhibit grass seed germination. make a note to apply pre-emergent crabgrass killer next march or april. corn gluten is an organic alternative for pre-emergent control in the spring.bermuda grassbermuda grass or wire grass is a tenacious perennial that spreads by stolons and rhizomes. it is difficult to dig out because it can grow deeply and sprout from remnant pieces. the best tool for removing a patch of bermuda grass is a garden fork. if bermuda grass is a major problem, you can pull surface runners and overseed this fall, but plan for a complete renovation next year by applying a nonselective herbicide in the summer. more than one application may be needed to kill the bermuda grass, and the last application should be a month before seeding grass, less if using glyphosate (without extended control). bayer advanced sells an herbicide targeted for this weed (bermudagrass control for lawns), but it may need to be applied monthly for seven months for full effect. fescues can be sown soon after application, but bluegrass needs a three-week interval.wild violetsvherbicides make short work of the foliage, but mature violets have robust rhizomes that just keep coming back. dig out violets using a fishtail weeder or a mattock.uwhite clover can take over large areas of lawn. many people see clover as a desirable part of an environmentally friendly lawn and leave it. a broadleaf weed killer such as weed b gone will work against clover, though two or three sprayings may be necessary and you must wait four weeks between the last application and sowing grass seed - too late for this season. alternatively, you can dig out clover or reduce its stand with a rake or core aerator as you prepare for seeding.control dandelions by digging out weeds using a fishtail weeder, or use a broadleaf herbicide next year after your new lawn is established.nutsedge, also called nutgrass, regrows from small underground corms and is difficult to eradicate. professional landscapers have access to target herbicides not available to consumers. if pulled repeatedly when young, the plants will die off eventually.as with ground ivy and wild strawberry, nutsedge flourishes where the lawn is poorly drained.",,,1330,0.2312,"['grass', 'weeds', 'lawn', 'herbicide', 'clover', 'bermuda', 'nutsedge', 'emergent', 'weeder', 'seeding', 'crabgrass', 'application', 'rhizomes', 'fishtail', 'broadleaf', 'weed', 'violets', 'dig', 'seed', 'sprout', 'pre', 'nutgrass', 'bermudagrass', 'control', 'stolons', 'regrows', 'overseed', 'mattock', 'sprayings', 'fescues', 'nonselective', 'corms', 'aerator', 'killer', 'glyphosate', 'fall', 'germination', 'plants', 'using', 'dandelions', 'apply', 'kill', 'landscapers', 'herbicides', 'pull', 'wild', 'perpetuates', 'sown', 'interval', 'sowing', 'inhibit', 'bayer', 'remnant', 'unsightly', 'deficient', 'gluten', 'alternatively', 'upkeep', 'compost', 'rake', 'tenacious', 'stand', 'eradicate', 'flourishes', 'dispersed', 'foliage', 'bluegrass', 'difficult', 'work', 'lawns', 'strawberry', 'frost', 'environmentally', 'desirable', 'drained', 'fork', 'spreads', 'perennial', 'ivy', 'void', 'digging', 'patch', 'renovation', 'applying', 'seeds', 'organic', 'mature', 'pile', 'corn', 'poorly', 'robust', 'removing', 'runners', 'soil', 'declining', 'trash', 'underground', 'preparation', 'wire', 'sells', 'repair', 'addressed', 'tool', 'best', 'applied', 'tackle', 'targeted', 'monthly', 'surface', 'bag', 'roots', 'prepare', 'advanced', 'tend', 'deeply', 'alternative', 'core', 'friendly', 'repeatedly', 'extended', 'die', 'garden', 'consumers', 'pieces', 'established', 'healthy', 'don', 'trust', 'ultimately', 'target', 'grow', 'reduce', 'pulled', 'telling', 'note', 'make', 'necessary', 'professional', 'waiting', 'wait', 'eventually', 'access', 'cause', 'effect', 'areas', 'common', 'complete', 'annual', 'ground', 'gone', 'killed', 'spring', 'leave', 'april', 'defense', 'needs', 'available', 'june', 'soon', 'hand', 'needed', 'year', 'march', 'summer', 'problem', 'post', 'short', 'large', 'plan', 'coming', 'seven', 'weeks', 'young', 'number', 'small', 'major', 'months', 'look', 'late', 'use', 'season', 'month', 'need', 'called', 'left', 'old', 'week', 'people', 'just', 'new']",0.9481,0.0519,0.8876,0.1124,0.0012,0.9729,0.0259,0.0795

""i have other commitments"" is more than you owe anyone who is pressing you for reasons, but there's no reason to be a purist; offer it as your reason, then don't budge from there.re: saying ""no"":i think a bit of context can help here, too. when i was going through a rather hard time, i started saying no to everything, including family weddings, because i simply did not want to deal. a few people did push back, because they saw a pattern that i did not. it made me angry at the time, but now i am glad they did so. it helped push me toward some much-needed therapy. if you're always saying no, i think a good friend will gently nudge to figure out why.good point. i do think it's important, though, for gentle nudgers to make it clear that they're worried about you vs. worried about what your absence says about them.write to",,,1260,0.1963,"['saying', 'reasons', 'pushback', 'meddling', 'nudgers', 'feel', 'sister', 'owe', 'weaseling', 'law', 'carolyn', 'okay', 'just', 'reason', 'problem', 'snipe', 'rebuffs', 'good', 'verges', 'did', 'matchmaking', 'worried', 'resents', 'purist', 'aggravate', 'does', 'push', 'condescending', 'relationship', 'reconnect', 'budge', 'like', 'know', 'think', 'persistence', 'nudge', 'step', 'bit', 'noticing', 'offer', 'invitations', 'jealous', 'soften', 'clan', 'selfish', 'boundary', 'speculate', 'thankful', 'groove', 'hi', 'don', 'weddings', 'inclusive', 'polite', 'planners', 'commitments', 'issuing', 'considerably', 'gently', 'assuming', 'gentle', 'adapted', 'business', 'define', 'declining', 'pressing', 'therapy', 'worn', 'counting', 'explanation', 'glad', 'better', 'context', 'demanded', 'backing', 'time', 'challenged', 'pattern', 'help', 'absence', 'harm', 'afraid', 'challenging', 'thank', 'angry', 'mom', 'decline', 'existing', 'vs', 'discussion', 'aware', 'dear', 'weren', 'write', 'unless', 'setting', 'value', 'yes', 'sound', 'forced', 'figure', 'common', 'online', 'daughter', 'simply', 'events', 'friend', 'actually', 'included', 'example', 'longer', 'wants', 'saw', 'helped', 'party', 'role', 'friends', 'continue', 'needed', 'mother', 'bad', 'fact', 'clear', 'probably', 'deal', 'thought', 'started', 'important', 'kind', 'history', 'getting', 'hard', 'went', 'said', 'start', 'recent', 'things', 'point', 'family', 'really', 'says', 've', 'want', 'work', 'including', 'going', 'make', 'people']",0.9979,0.0021,0.4383,0.5617,0.0032,0.9959,0.0009,0.5284
1771998110,Washington Post The,2016-03-11,Commentary,EDITORIAL - OPINION,Politics,A.15,775,Making America even worse,"good countries can sometimes go bad. donald trump's supporters implicitly make this argument when they proclaim, ""make america great again."" and so do those who loathe trump and see in him a dangerous populist response to the anger of frustrated middle-class voters.the rise of trump, love him or hate him, conveys an inescapable message: the united states' political institutions are in decay, and voters are angry at a government that they perceive (correctly) to be broken. the danger is that trump's responses would probably make the underlying governance problems worse - and increase polarization and dysfunction even more.the evidence of ""trump rage"" has been clear in nearly every primary and poll this year. ron fournier of the atlantic summed up the basic message when he quoted a voter in flint, mich., about the catastrophic failure of that city's water system: ""what matters to me as an american, what should matter to all americans, is that we learn from this: how do we change the way government works? how do we fix these systems?""here's the puzzle: a country that is angry at ""government"" or ""washington"" will have difficulty fixing problems that result from the breakdown of public services caused by underfunding, incompetence and the predominance of private ""special"" interests over the public interest. what's needed isn't less government, but better government - which costs money and requires good leadership.america's political dysfunction is the subject of an important book called ""political order and political decay,"" published in 2014 by francis fukuyama, a stanford university social theorist. fukuyama became famous for asserting the triumph of liberal social order in his 1989 post-cold war essay, ""the end of history?"" he has been trying ever since to sort out why that forecast proved so premature.fukuyama notes long-ago examples of thriving systems that grew rigid and failed to adapt to change, from the han dynasty in china to the mamluks in egypt to the old regime in france. he warns: ""modern liberal democracies are no less subject to political decay than other types of regimes."" theorists imagine that democracies are self-correcting, but that doesn't happen if voters ""are poorly organized, or they fail to understand their own interests correctly.""decay happens when agencies that are supposed to serve the public are captured by elites, or overmanaged by elected officials, or buffeted by what robert kagan calls ""adversarial legalism."" basically, fukuyama makes an argument for competent, uncorrupted bureaucrats - ""public servants,"" as they were once known. his model of an agency shattered by conflicting political mandates and poor management is the u.s. forest service, which went from a ""gold standard"" mission of managing forest resources to a secondary (and misconceived) goal of preventing forest fires.""it would be one thing if the u.s. forest service were an isolated case of political decay,"" fukuyama writes. unfortunately, ""the overall quality of the american government has been deteriorating steadily for more than a generation.""the deep anti-government hostility of the modern republican party is part of the problem. tax cuts have starved many government agencies of money and good people. fukuyama notes that medicare and medicaid, which account for 22 percent of the federal budget, are managed by 0.2 percent of federal workers. as the federal workforce has dwindled, the number of contractors has exploded. taxpayers suspect that it's a con, and they're right.congress meddles with the federal agencies rather than passing legislation to solve problems. fukuyama notes that the pentagon is mandated to send congress nearly 500 reports a year. ""the united states is trapped in a bad equilibrium,"" fukuyama writes. ""congress mandates complex rules that reduce the government's autonomy and make decisions slow and expensive. the government then doesn't perform well, which confirms people's original distrust.""an angry public watches as the rich get richer, the middle class stagnates and government does nothing. middle-class prosperity and self-confidence have been the foundation of u.s. democracy. yet the pew research center estimates that the share of household income going to middle-class families fell from 62 percent in 1970 to 43 percent in 2014, while the share for upper-income families rose from 29 percent to 49 percent.trump gives an angry america someone to blame: muslims, mexicans, government bureaucrats, free-trade negotiators, politicians, journalists. but he doesn't begin to address the real problem of how to fix the united states' political decay.""no one living in an established liberal democracy should . . . be complacent about the inevitability of its survival,"" warns fukuyama. or as benjamin franklin put it in 1787: ""a republic, if you can keep it.""",Congress,,1320,0.2181,"['fukuyama', 'decay', 'government', 'political', 'trump', 'angry', 'forest', 'percent', 'liberal', 'democracies', 'class', 'bureaucrats', 'dysfunction', 'mamluks', 'middle', 'agencies', 'notes', 'mandates', 'public', 'overmanaged', 'voters', 'warns', 'correctly', 'federal', 'legalism', 'congress', 'meddles', 'uncorrupted', 'stagnates', 'misconceived', 'problems', 'predominance', 'writes', 'democracy', 'fix', 'america', 'argument', 'interests', 'underfunding', 'fournier', '2014', 'doesn', 'united', '1787', 'systems', 'states', 'make', 'subject', 'modern', 'income', 'adversarial', 'loathe', 'theorist', 'equilibrium', 'buffeted', 'theorists', 'inevitability', 'implicitly', 'complacent', 'proclaim', 'inescapable', 'polarization', 'correcting', 'kagan', 'families', 'message', 'conveys', 'incompetence', 'self', 'dwindled', 'regimes', 'elites', 'han', 'flint', 'starved', 'share', 'summed', 'order', 'perceive', 'mexicans', 'good', 'social', 'distrust', 'deteriorating', 'servants', 'confirms', 'rigid', 'asserting', 'autonomy', 'competent', 'dynasty', 'hostility', 'bad', 'richer', 'problem', 'pew', 'negotiators', 'populist', 'conflicting', 'catastrophic', 'governance', 'premature', 'puzzle', 'thriving', 'mandated', 'prosperity', 'adapt', 'breakdown', 'fixing', 'shattered', 'service', 'essay', 'medicaid', 'change', 'watches', 'workforce', 'nearly', 'exploded', 'rage', 'muslims', 'egypt', 'underlying', 'steadily', 'triumph', 'trapped', 'preventing', 'responses', 'poorly', 'medicare', 'money', 'fires', 'contractors', 'secondary', '1970', 'isolated', 'mich', 'survival', 'quoted', 'voter', 'examples', 'difficulty', 'regime', 'francis', 'benjamin', 'taxpayers', 'stanford', 'franklin', 'forecast', 'journalists', 'solve', 'household', 'pentagon', 'frustrated', 'fail', 'republic', '1989', 'american', 'anger', 'captured', 'poll', 'hate', 'managing', 'basically', 'unfortunately', 'institutions', 'types', 'atlantic', 'danger', 'blame', 'estimates', 'ron', '62', 'organized', 'suspect', 'politicians', 'proved', 'upper', 'perform', 'imagine', 'matters', 'managed', 'basic', 'failure', 'passing', 'established', 'cuts', 'requires', 'france', '49', '43', 'legislation', 'famous', 'expensive', 'supporters', 'generation', 'elected', 'dangerous', 'confidence', 'broken', 'primary']",0.9998,0.0002,0.9069,0.0931,0.9991,0.0006,0.0003,0.7493
2149891732,Washington Post The,2018-12-02,News,A-SECTION,Public prosecutors,A.2,1087,Mueller's probe unearths liars surrounding Trump,"as special counsel robert s. mueller iii moves toward the summation of his investigation - and whatever his eventual report produces - there is no escaping the sleaze factor that existed around president trump before and during his campaign for the white house in 2016.it was there in the presence of paul manafort, who arrived at the campaign in the spring of 2016 and lasted until embarrassing and continued disclosures about his past work with pro-russian officials in ukraine forced him to step aside, and whose recent plea agreement was tossed out this past week because prosecutors say he has continued to lie to them.it was there in the presence of michael cohen, trump's longtime personal lawyer and fixer, who did the deals and arranged the payoffs that were designed to suppress damaging allegations about trump and other women during the final months of the campaign and whose new guilty plea about lying to congress has put renewed focus on the president's words and actions.it was there in the presence of roger stone, a practitioner of the dark arts of politics and a one-time business partner with manafort, who acted over the years as a political adviser and confidant to trump and whose apparent knowledge of leaks of emails damaging to hillary clinton's campaign has put him in the crosshairs of the mueller team.it was there in the presence of rick gates, manafort's business partner, who continued in the trump campaign after manafort had departed and who had participated with manafort in a series of fraudulent money-laundering schemes and other escapades that came to light thanks to mueller's team of prosecutors.it was there in the presence of jerome corsi, an inveterate right-wing conspiracy theorist, whose statements to prosecutors about the leaks of democratic and clinton campaign emails via wikileaks produced a draft plea agreement for lying that he ultimately refused to sign, leaving him still dangling for future legal action.it was even there in the presence of george papadopoulos, the low-level foreign policy adviser to the campaign currently serving a two-week prison sentence for lying to federal prosecutors, who sought to leverage his access within the campaign to aggrandize himself in the eyes of foreign diplomats and others.no one yet knows where all this will ultimately lead or when it will end, in terms of the legal jeopardy for these and others who have been caught up in the mueller's web. but the tawdriness factor alone with this rogues' gallery of characters is enough to put the lie to trump's claim of hiring ""only the best"" to advise him in business or government.collectively, you can't make it up. which is why there is again so much focus on the president as central to the investigation. trump has suffered through other bad moments since mueller was appointed to investigate the role russia played in the 2016 election and the degree to which there was cooperation, collusion, conspiracy, advance knowledge or any other kind of involvement by anyone associated with the trump campaign. by any measure, the past week ranks as one of the worst for the president.what is striking at this point, although not a surprise given past histories and the people involved, is the mountain of lying that has taken place. if cohen's admission that he lied to congress is corroborated by additional evidence from materials seized from his office or testimony, the president has long been lying about his business ventures in russia, especially when he was a candidate in 2016 and went soft on russian president vladimir putin. and as cohen's plea makes clear, others have been lying on trump's behalf.as he left the white house on thursday for the group of 20 meeting in argentina, the president said cohen is now lying about having lied to congress. he also said that, even if he did what cohen said, what does it matter? he was a businessman while he was a candidate.rudolph w. giuliani, one of the president's personal legal advisers, has said repeatedly that cohen has lied for years. why did trump keep as his personal lawyer someone whose word was so untrustworthy for so many years? because, trump said, ""a long time ago he did me a favor."" apparently, for trump, a past transaction overrode questions of honesty and integrity in the selection of a personal attorney. is that believable?whether cohen's latest confession contradicts the president's written answers to mueller is, of course, of great interest and importance. mueller and his team know the answer by now.giuliani has said that nothing cohen is now saying contradicts what trump said in his filing to the special counsel. which then begs the question of why trump is accusing cohen of lying now, unless trump's answer to the special counsel about any efforts to make a deal with the russians was so vague, so anodyne, so full of caveats that it could protect him against all contingencies no matter how much cohen's testimony has changed.the web of lies thrown up by the characters who were most prominent in the mueller investigation this past week is difficult to overstate, although perhaps easy to dismiss as typical, given their histories. in any criminal case like this, targets of the prosecutors and some of the eventual witnesses for the prosecution are rarely saints. they come with their own baggage, which must be weighed by jurors.that was the case when gates testified against manafort and was confronted during cross-examination by manafort's lawyers with his own history of lying and fraud. yet in the end, manafort was convicted on most counts in that case, leading him to cut a deal with prosecutors ahead of a second trial, a deal now on the rocks because of more lies.the flurry of activity over the past week has highlighted the various pieces that mueller and his team are working and the degree that they could involve trump directly. the connection is trump and russia. the president's statement to the new york post that a pardon for manafort is not off the table adds to the other element for the investigators to assess.there will be more surprises ahead from the special counsel's office, which must worry those now feeling the glare from the mueller team. there also will be more evidence of lying - which is to be expected given the unsavory band of actors who are at the center of it all.",Congress,"Trump, Donald J",1870,0.2144,"['manafort', 'trump', 'mueller', 'cohen', 'lying', 'campaign', 'prosecutors', 'presence', 'president', 'plea', 'counsel', 'past', 'lied', '2016', 'contradicts', 'personal', 'russia', 'giuliani', 'team', 'leaks', 'special', 'histories', 'emails', 'eventual', 'investigation', 'damaging', 'continued', 'week', 'business', 'aggrandize', 'congress', 'legal', 'tawdriness', 'gates', 'conspiracy', 'lie', 'lies', 'testimony', 'said', 'adviser', 'corsi', 'deal', 'factor', 'papadopoulos', 'russian', 'given', 'anodyne', 'knowledge', 'characters', 'did', 'inveterate', 'sleaze', 'overrode', 'summation', 'crosshairs', 'case', 'untrustworthy', 'escapades', 'contingencies', 'ultimately', 'partner', 'rogues', 'candidate', 'degree', 'clinton', 'lawyer', 'corroborated', 'agreement', 'theorist', 'web', 'overstate', 'wikileaks', 'payoffs', 'unsavory', 'caveats', 'fixer', 'answer', 'foreign', 'begs', 'evidence', 'collusion', 'confidant', 'practitioner', 'believable', 'glare', 'focus', 'ahead', 'pardon', 'dangling', 'suppress', 'confession', 'laundering', 'matter', 'escaping', 'disclosures', 'fraudulent', 'baggage', 'schemes', 'rudolph', 'honesty', 'collectively', 'jeopardy', 'flurry', 'departed', 'advise', 'ventures', 'argentina', 'jerome', 'vague', 'surprises', 'russians', 'dismiss', 'diplomats', 'jurors', 'existed', 'transaction', 'leverage', 'weighed', 'putin', 'embarrassing', 'rocks', 'examination', 'highlighted', 'assess', 'accusing', 'confronted', 'tossed', 'white', 'produces', 'office', 'years', 'ukraine', 'saints', 'businessman', 'participated', 'vladimir', 'arranged', 'advisers', 'lasted', 'integrity', 'renewed', 'prosecution', 'element', 'acted', 'cooperation', 'testified', 'house', 'involve', 'seized', 'hillary', 'involvement', 'investigate', 'admission', 'filing', 'targets', 'witnesses', 'hiring', 'end', 'gallery', 'roger', 'thrown', 'behalf', 'fraud', 'ranks', 'counts', 'apparent', 'selection', 'importance', 'materials', 'appointed', 'striking', 'sentence', 'actors', 'answers', 'statements', 'iii', 'wing', 'mountain', 'adds', 'prominent', 'typical', 'rick', 'allegations', 'rarely', 'soft', 'convicted', 'investigators', 'stone', 'deals', 'repeatedly', 'activity', 'connection', 'long', 'guilty', 'aside', 'draft', 'lawyers', 'pieces', 'refused', 'moves']",0.2701,0.7299,0.6521,0.348,0.9949,0.0048,0.0004,0.5475
742633964,Washington Post The,2010-08-13,News,A SECTION,Gays & lesbians,A.2,668,Judge: Gay marriages may resume in Calif.; Opponents given 6 days to seek an injunction from a higher court,"a federal judge in san francisco ruled on thursday that same-sex marriages in california may resume as soon as wednesday, but gave opponents until then to seek an injunction from a higher court.u.s. district judge vaughn r. walker struck down last week california's voter-approved ban on same-sex unions, calling it discriminatory and unconstitutional. but he delayed implementation of his ruling after opponents asked for a stay while the case is being appealed.walker denied their request on thursday, but he offered a six-day delay. that gave hope to opponents who have brought appealed the case before the u.s. court of appeals for the 9th circuit.""i'm happy that the judge issued a temporary stay until next week,"" said brian raum, senior counsel for the alliance defense fund, a christian legal aid group that participated in the case. ""that gives us the window we need to seek a more permanent stay as it goes before the 9th circuit.""gay rights groups hailed walker's decision as a victory, although it disappointed gay couples around the state who had lined up at city halls in hopes of getting married thursday.""it's making the long drive home even more miserable,"" said midge detro, 45, a resident of a town about two hours south of san francisco.she and her partner of 16 years, sandy simmons, awoke at dawn to arrive at san francisco city hall to be among the first to marry on thursday. instead, they filled out forms, had lunch and headed home with plans to return on wednesday.""i just hope they don't try anything next week,"" detro said. ""that's the only scary part of this whole thing.""last week's ruling by walker invalidated proposition 8, a ballot initiative that defined marriage as between a man and a woman. the decision was viewed by both sides as a landmark moment in the battle over same-sex marriage, even though the fight is far from over. the case is widely expected to end up before the supreme court.supporters of proposition 8 had argued that heterosexual marriage is a building block of society because of its role in procreation and that the ballot initiative, which passed in 2008 with 52 percent of the vote, reflected the will of the people.but in a  138-page ruling, walker largely agreed with supporters of same-sex marriage that proposition 8 violates gay  couples' equal rights as outlined in the constitution's 14th amendment.even before walker handed down his decision last week, defenders of proposition 8 had asked for an immediate stay while they pursued an appeal, arguing that allowing same-sex marriages to go forward would cause ""irreparable injury"" to residents of the state. they also said any marriages performed before the case reached its final disposition would be legally questionable.but in thursday's 11-page opinion, walker wrote that the defenders of proposition 8 ""fail to satisfy any of the factors necessary to warrant a stay."" moreover, he questioned whether the lawyers, who come from religious and nonprofit groups, have the legal standing to appeal.neither gov. arnold schwarzenegger (r) nor state attorney general jerry brown (d) agreed to defend proposition 8 in court, and both weighed in on the side of overturning it.walker wrote that it appears ""at least doubtful that proponents will be able to proceed with their appeal without a state defendant."" he denied a stay, he wrote, ""except for a limited time solely in order to permit the court of appeals to consider the issue in an orderly manner.""supporters of same-sex marriage praised the stark language of the opinion and said they regard the delay as a formality.""the court's decision today recognizes that there is no reason to delay allowing gay men and lesbians to enjoy the same rights that virtually all other citizens already enjoy,"" theodore b. olson, one of the two lawyers who led the effort to invalidate proposition 8, said in a statement.",,"Walker, Vaughn R",1540,0.227,"['proposition', 'walker', 'detro', 'sex', 'marriage', 'stay', 'gay', 'marriages', 'court', 'delay', 'case', 'thursday', 'ruling', 'opponents', 'decision', 'supporters', '9th', 'appeal', 'francisco', 'appealed', 'judge', 'defenders', 'week', 'couples', 'rights', 'raum', 'ballot', 'wrote', 'initiative', 'appeals', 'san', 'circuit', 'midge', 'procreation', 'state', 'opinion', 'enjoy', 'lawyers', 'denied', 'said', 'allowing', 'seek', 'invalidate', 'invalidated', 'irreparable', 'formality', 'page', 'disposition', 'heterosexual', 'legal', 'overturning', 'agreed', 'awoke', 'lesbians', 'groups', 'discriminatory', 'orderly', 'doubtful', 'injunction', 'vaughn', 'hope', 'violates', '138', 'olson', 'schwarzenegger', 'implementation', 'gave', 'california', 'miserable', 'simmons', 'recognizes', 'unconstitutional', 'theodore', 'proponents', 'halls', 'satisfy', 'hailed', 'outlined', 'marry', 'pursued', 'weighed', 'solely', 'questionable', 'wednesday', 'asked', 'defendant', 'stark', 'proceed', 'warrant', 'participated', 'arnold', 'scary', 'voter', 'regard', 'unions', 'sandy', 'legally', '14th', 'dawn', 'permit', 'reflected', 'landmark', 'defined', 'amendment', 'resume', 'manner', 'praised', 'arguing', 'lined', 'fail', 'city', 'alliance', 'disappointed', 'delayed', 'arrive', 'viewed', 'constitution', 'defend', 'factors', 'forms', 'questioned', 'counsel', 'temporary', 'equal', 'permanent', 'virtually', 'lunch', 'ban', 'nonprofit', 'immediate', 'religious', 'jerry', 'performed', 'ruled', 'handed', 'widely', 'christian', 'window', 'argued', 'resident', '52', 'supreme', 'home', 'headed', 'aid', 'citizens', 'married', 'request', 'sides', 'partner', 'language', 'necessary', 'struck', '2008', 'injury', 'filled', 'issued', 'appears', 'brian', 'approved', 'gov', 'largely', 'standing', 'fund', 'battle', 'limited', 'gives', 'calling', 'hopes', 'society', 'cause', 'happy', 'block', 'brown', 'consider', 'reached', 'passed', 'hall', 'vote', 'fight', 'attorney', 'offered', '45', 'residents', 'moment', 'higher', 'goes', 'reason', 'drive', 'brought', 'town', 'forward', 'order', 'effort', 'statement', 'defense', 'woman', 'victory', 'role', 'soon']",0.9738,0.0262,0.528,0.472,0.0011,0.9982,0.0007,0.3602
