As Favoring Whites, a Poll Finds","['a significant majority of new yorkers say the police department favors whites over blacks, according to a new poll by the new york times.', 'that view, as widespread now as it was in 2001 during the administration of mayor rudolph w. giuliani, is particularly prevalent among black new yorkers, 80 percent of whom say the police favor one race over the other. a plurality of white residents -- 48 percent -- agree.', ""concern about police favoritism comes at a time of intensified scrutiny of the department's extensive practice of stopping, questioning and, in many instances, frisking people on the city's streets. last year, the police made nearly 700,000 stops; about 85 percent of the stops involved blacks or hispanics."", 'the poll found that a majority of black residents said the stop-and-frisk tactic had led to the harassment of innocent people, but most white residents viewed the practice as an acceptable way to improve urban safety.', 'among all new yorkers, 48 percent said the tactic was ""acceptable to make new york city safer,"" while almost as many -- 45 percent -- deemed the tactic ""excessive."" most of those surveyed rejected mayor michael r. bloomberg\'s chief rationale for the practice, saying they did not think that stopping and frisking suspicious people had lowered the crime rate or reduced the use of illegal guns.', '""stop-and-frisk would be a good idea if they did it right,"" jose aponte, 64, a retired doorman who lives in the bronx, said in a follow-up interview after the poll. ""but it\'s not decreasing crime or guns. there are more shootings every day.""', ""but mr. bloomberg and the police commissioner, raymond w. kelly, received high marks on the crime issue: 57 percent of new yorkers said they approved of the way the mayor was dealing with crime, and 61 percent said they approved of the way the commissioner was handling his job. even 50 percent of the respondents who said they had been the target of a racially motivated police stop approved of mr. kelly's management."", '""i live in brooklyn, in coney island, and everybody has guns; 3-year-old kids have guns! it\'s outrageous,"" said johnny rivera, 52, a former foreman at an aluminum company. as for the stop-and-frisk tactic, he said, ""the worst thing they could do is stop it.""', ""mr. bloomberg, who has overseen a significant rise in the number of stops during his nearly 11 years in office, scored slightly lower on his stewardship of race relations, with half of residents saying they approved and one-third saying they disapproved. just 36 percent of black residents said they approved of the mayor's handling of race relations."", 'james westcott, a bronx resident who has been unemployed for two years, said he had been stopped by the police on three occasions.

napping on deck, and rubbing shoulders in tight living quarters. and most daring, are dramatically posed and lighted studies of nude male bodies: torsos, buttocks, genitals. in these images, the mood is erotic without being furtive. these are clearly collaborations with willing models."", 'after discharge from the service, mr. baltrop returned to new york city, where he lived on the lower east side with a woman named alice and made a living as a taxi driver. by this point, just a few years after stonewall, the piers had become the main stage for an openly expressed gay sexuality, and they drew mr. baltrop in. initially he used his flexible hours as a cabby to visit and photograph them. then, to gain more time, he quit driving, bought a van and, supporting himself as a freelance mover, camped there for days and nights on end.', ""there's no question that he considered his photographs -- particularly of pier 52, then located at the end of gansevoort street, just beyond where the whitney museum of american art now stands -- a long-term project, a mix of historical documentation, insider anthropology, and autobiography. life on the piers, with its definable demographic and culture of confinement, was not so different from that on board a ship, and mr. baltrop viewed it both from afar and up close. the more than 200 pictures in the bronx show are very much about pulling back for the broad view, then zeroing in."", 'he was careful to give the piers a context. he shot the waterfront neighborhood with its bars (the ramrod, badlands, the stud), its transient hotels, and its commercial truck parking lots (which also served as nocturnal trysting places). and he photographed, at varying distances, the abandoned shipping depots and warehouse sheds on the piers themselves.', 'as a group, these images are invaluable contributions to american urban visual history, but also to art history. a lot of new art was happening on the piers. in 1975, the new york artist gordon matta-clark sliced a huge crescent-shaped, light flooded hole in a west-facing wall on pier 52 and titled it ""day\'s end""; a painter named tava (gustav von will) was doing murals, as were younger contemporaries like mike bidlo and david wojnarowicz. mr. baltrop recorded some of this work, though it seemed incidental to his true interest. what really gripped him was the grandeur and danger of structural ruin, and the people who occupied it.', ""look closely at his panoramic views of pier exteriors and you'll see, in many, the presence of tiny figures, clothed or nude, leaning from windows, lounging around, having sex. and the majority of his shots were of populated interiors. in pier 52, he used a homemade version of a window-cleaner's harness to suspend himself from the ceiling and survey activities below. at the same time, because he became a regular, unthreatening presence, he was able to photograph on-the-ground action, much of it sexual, from an intimate vantage."", 'the piers were not benign places, and mr. baltrop knew it. muggings were common. murders happened. he took chilling pictures of the police fishing bodies from the hudson. (one locally famous waterfront habitué, the drag queen and activist marsha p. johnson, of whom mr. baltrop made a wonderful portrait, was found dead in the river in 1992.) he spoke, later in his life, of ""the frightening, mad, unbelievable, violent, beautiful things that were going on"" at the piers. he was aware that his own attraction to them had a pathological element. ""it became an addiction,"" he said. ""it was like a drug. it was a drug.""', 'yet you find little sense of menace in the photographs, most of which are black and white, with a few in color. raw, cavernous interiors have a church-like luminosity. and, despite repeated images of bare flesh the work can feel erotic but chaste, the way thomas eakins\'s paintings of adolescent boys at a swimming hole do. much has been made of the ""classical"" poise of explicitly sexual images by baltrop\'s celebrated contemporaries peter hujar and robert mapplethorpe. but mr. baltrop\'s a classicist too, just a less self-conscious one.', 'so why has he been all but ignored until fairly recently? again, his outsider status as a queer working-class african-american is a big part of the answer. (he had two small shows, one in a bar where he moonlighted as a bouncer, but one gallery owner who saw the pictures referred to him as ""a real sewer rat type""; another accused him of stealing work by a white photographer.) fortunately, toward the end of his life, he met the painter randal wilcox, who immediately saw the value of his photography and, after mr. baltrop\'s death from cancer in 2004, rescued it from what could easily have been obliteration.', ""in addition to a cache of personal items -- identity cards, medical records, cameras -- that are in the bronx show, mr. baltrop left behind a handful of beat-up photographic prints and thousands of rolls of film that he couldn't afford to have processed. in 2008, an artforum essay by the writer and curator douglas crimp (reprinted in the exhibition catalog) put mr. baltrop's name into circulation, and his reputation continues to grow. this fall his work will be included in the rehang of the museum of modern art's permanent collection. he's also in the whitney's collection. (on the site of pier 52, which served for more than a decade as his studio and sometime home, a public art project by the artist david hammons, organized by the whitney and the hudson river park trust, began construction this week.)"", 'mr. baltrop himself might well be hard pressed today to recognize the part of the city he once recorded. among the show\'s latest images is one of a pier engulfed in flames and smoke. the picture may well date from around 1986, when the ""sex piers"" began to be demolished by the city, to be replaced by the luxury condos, entertainment centers and the transplanted uptown museum there today. it\'s gratifying to think of mr. baltrop, brilliant, persistent, and fully resurrected in the bronx show, as the true phoenix arising from the ashes.', 'the life and times of alvin baltrop', 'through feb. 9 at the bronx museum of the arts, 1040 grand concourse; 718-681-6000, bronxmuseum.org.', 'the life and times of alvin baltrop through feb. 9 at the bronx museum of the arts; 718-681-6000, bronxmuseum.org.']",Bronx Museum of the Arts-New York City NY,1,0.7248445215978121,0.8192427572059003,0.0,0.1807572493991373,"['baltrop', 'piers', 'mr', 'bronx', 'pier', 'alvin', 'museum', 'art', 'images', 'hudson', 'bronxmuseum', 'whitney', 'pictures', 'life', '52']"

trump's lead in seeking to undo the legacy of his predecessor, and education secretary betsy devos diligently tore into president barack obama's policies."", 'president-elect joseph r. biden jr. is planning to return the favor.', ""the contrasts in trump-era education policy and the incoming biden agenda are stark. ms. devos, a lifelong booster of private schools and opponent of the teachers' unions, set out to reduce the education department's footprint by proposing cuts to public school funding and narrowing the department's enforcement of federal education laws and civil rights."", ""the incoming first lady, jill biden, is a community college professor and member of the national education association, the nation's largest teachers' union. the biden administration has promised to drastically increase resources for public schools, expand civil rights advocacy for marginalized students and reassert department leadership in policymaking."", 'on the most pressing issue facing education, reopening schools during the pandemic, the biden administration has signaled a sharply different approach.', ""the trump administration has demanded that schools reopen, despite severe budget constraints and confusing health guidelines, while the education department has all but absolved itself of tracking the virus's impact and offering solutions. the biden campaign has promised federal relief funding and assistance for schools to address the devastating effects of the pandemic on the academic trajectory of their most vulnerable students."", ""but the president-elect's closeness with the powerful teachers' unions has raised concerns. unions have come under fire from parents and school leaders who say their opposition to in-person instruction conflicts with science and students' well-being. ms. devos posted a series of articles on twitter that have questioned the unions' roles."", '""when unions win, kids lose,"" she said.', 'with a likely republican senate and a narrow democratic majority in the house, mr. biden will struggle to accomplish some of his loftiest policy goals. he has promised to bolster funding for special education, institute universal prekindergarten and triple funding for a federal program that helps schools serving high concentrations of students from low-income families, devoting some of that funding to teacher salaries. in higher education, he has promised free public college, expanding federal financial aid and canceling some student debt.', 'stef feldman, the biden campaign\'s policy director, told reporters last

immense backlog of loan forgiveness claims that the trump administration let pile up, and the denials of assistance the department has issued to students who claim they were cheated by their colleges,
