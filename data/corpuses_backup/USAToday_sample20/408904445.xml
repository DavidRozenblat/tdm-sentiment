Then, not far behind, the taxman.&lt;/p&gt;              &lt;p&gt;   More than 16 million people watched in September as ABC's Extreme Makeover: Home Edition gave the Woffords of Encinitas, Calif., the royal treatment, sending Brian Wofford and his eight kids to the Caribbean while the crew razed and rebuilt the family's house.&lt;/p&gt;              &lt;p&gt;   What viewers didn't see was the visit San Diego County officials later paid to the family, which has had difficulty making ends meet since the death of mom Teresa Wofford four years ago. The assessor's office more than doubled the value of the property -- taken by Extreme Makeover from 1,200 square feet up to about 4,300 -- to $572,879. The new property tax bill: about $6,000, up from about $2,700.&lt;/p&gt;              &lt;p&gt;   "It was a total redo," says David Butler, the county's assistant assessor. "So we treated it as a totally new house, basically."&lt;/p&gt;              &lt;p&gt;   The Woffords' house is among the show's more extreme projects, according to building permits and tax assessment records reviewed by USA TODAY. In Los Angeles County, the show's work on a house owned by Rodney and Kristen Powers pushed its assessed value up $42,000. Work on a house owned by Trent and Dawna Woslum brought a $19,000 increase. Property tax for both probably will increase by several hundred dollars.&lt;/p&gt;              &lt;p&gt;   "We're very upfront with the families in telling them that there's a likelihood that the value of the house will increase, and therefore there will be a resulting property tax increase," says David Goldberg, president of show producer Endemol USA. "But we see that as a worthwhile tradeoff for receiving a new home, and I can't tell you how many letters I've received from families saying, 'You changed my life.' "&lt;/p&gt;              &lt;p&gt;   But how about income taxes on all the appliances, toys and building materials people get? Goldberg says the show pays each family $50,000 to rent its house for 10 days, and it relies on federal tax rules that say income on rentals of less than 15 days is non-taxable. The producers also believe that any improvements they make to the house while renting it also are non-taxable.&lt;/p&gt;              &lt;p&gt;   "We consulted not one but many, many experts in the field," Goldberg says of the solution, which saves families tens of thousands of dollars.&lt;/p&gt;              &lt;p&gt;   But others are skeptical. "We feel that is an argument that will not fly with the IRS," says Jackie Perlman, a tax researcher with H&amp;amp;R Block. "We go by intent, and the (show) is not there as renters, they are there to renovate."&lt;/p&gt;              &lt;p&gt;   An IRS spokeswoman had no comment.&lt;/p&gt;              &lt;p&gt;   Goldberg also downplays concerns about whether the families -- which ABC often describes as struggling to make ends meet -- can make their higher tax bills, not to mention increased utility bills.&lt;/p&gt;              &lt;p&gt;   "Endemol as well as ABC takes the welfare of each family seriously, and if it becomes a real problem we'll discuss the situation with them," he says. "The goal of this show is to help people."&lt;/p&gt;              &lt;p&gt;   Several Extreme Makeover families USA TODAY interviewed declined to discuss their financial situations, but all were ecstatic about their new houses.&lt;/p&gt;              &lt;p&gt;   "It was a tremendous, positive change," says Contessa Mendoza, a single mother whose Van Nuys, Calif., home was rebuilt by the show this year. "We have nice, new everything, and everything works."&lt;/p&gt;              &lt;p&gt;   ---&lt;/p&gt;              &lt;p&gt;   Contributing: Susan O'Brian&lt;/p&gt;              &lt;div&gt;&lt;object class="mstar_text_entity"&gt;&lt;param name="pq_source" value="csx"/&gt;&lt;param name="pq_etype" value="41"/&gt;&lt;param name="mstar_entity_inline" value="N"/&gt;&lt;param name="mstar_entity_type" value="Illustration"/&gt;&lt;div class="Illustration_content"&gt;&lt;p&gt;PHOTOS, Color, Tom Queally, ABC (3); Caption: Surprise!
