Hill watched Michael Jordan make his historic winning shot on television and immediately decided  he was a fan of both teams and that the event was worth watching every year.  &lt;/p&gt;              &lt;p&gt;"From that moment forward, I fell in love with basketball," Hill said.  &lt;/p&gt;              &lt;p&gt;By 1984, Hill was going on an annual trip to the Final Four with his father, Calvin. The tradition began when Calvin retired from the NFL and offered his son a trip to anywhere in the world he wanted to go -- a trip with "just the guys." Grant picked the Final Four, and they went from 1984 to 1988.  &lt;/p&gt;              &lt;p&gt;"We'd sneak into parties at the hotels and I'd get all of these pictures with these coaches, 12 years old. But then in '88 it all changed because now I'm getting recruited, so I couldn't go and do those types of things."  &lt;/p&gt;              &lt;p&gt;By then, Hill was hooked, and his appreciation for the 1982 Final Four grew. As a teen he would spend  afternoons with Chris Webber, watching the game over and over. Webber went on to Michigan, where he had his own classic moments in the FinalFour as part of the FabFive. And Hill went on to Duke, where he threw a 75-foot pass to Christian Laettner, who made the winning shot against Kentucky in overtime to send the Blue Devils to the 1992 Final Four.  &lt;/p&gt;              &lt;p&gt;"I remember the huddle, and I remember going to the huddle after Sean Woods hit the shot (to put Kentucky ahead) and thinking, 'Well, spring break's next week,'" Hill said.  &lt;/p&gt;              &lt;p&gt;"I mean, I don't know what I was thinking, but I thought the game was over. But Coach K (Mike Krzyzewski), having the presence of mind in that moment of all the excitement, the emotions in the building  he didn't panic. Before he drew up the play, in front of all of the guys in the huddle, he said, 'Grant, can you make the pass?'  &lt;/p&gt;              &lt;p&gt;"And I said, 'Yeah, I can make the pass.' And then he asked, 'Christian, can you make the shot?' And Christian, who hadn't missed all day said, 'Look, if Grant makes the pass, I'll make the shot.' And that to me pretty much embodied Christian Laettner at that point in his career. But Coach K asked us. I think it's powerful, as opposed to, 'You make a pass,' making an order that you do it; it was confirming it. And it was interesting. Maybe I'm reading too much into it, but whatever transpired in the huddle, walking out I felt like we were going to win."  &lt;/p&gt;              &lt;p&gt;They did, of course, and won the national title. Hill had a successful NBA career but is nonetheless reminded every year of his famous assist. "Sometimes I think it's the only thing I did in school, was the pass," he said.  &lt;/p&gt;              &lt;p&gt;Now, after more than two decades, he's back in the tournament on the No. 1 broadcast team for CBS in an NCAA tournament that looks surprisingly familiar: The tournament's coaches include not only ones with long careers such as Rick Pitino, John Calipari and Krzyzewski but also former NCAA tournament stars including Bryce Drew (Valparaiso) and Bobby Hurley (Buffalo). The CBS and Turner broadcast team, in addition to Hill, includes Mateen Cleaves, who carried Michigan State to the 2000 national title, and Webber.  &lt;/p&gt;              &lt;p&gt;And, of course, Duke and Kentucky could play in the title game.  &lt;/p&gt;              &lt;p&gt;"It's really incredible that everything that goes around comes around," former Connecticut coach Jim Calhoun said. "It's going around -- the Fab Five and everything that happened and the drama. Think about all the ink that was used to write about everything that happened, and now they're coming back and calling the games. I think it's great."&lt;/p&gt;              &lt;p&gt;Credit: Nina Mandell, @ninamandell, USA TODAY Sports&lt;/p&gt;              &lt;div&gt;&lt;object class="mstar_text_entity"&gt;&lt;param name="pq_source" value="csx"/&gt;&lt;param name="pq_etype" value="41"/&gt;&lt;param name="mstar_entity_inline" value="N"/&gt;&lt;param name="mstar_entity_type" value="Illustration"/&gt;&lt;div class="Illustration_content"&gt;&lt;p&gt;photo     Sean Dougherty, USA TODAY Sports&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;/div&gt;            &lt;/body&gt;          &lt;/html&gt;</Text>
