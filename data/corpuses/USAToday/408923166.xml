      <Text WordCount="455" HTMLContent="true">&lt;html&gt;            &lt;head&gt;              &lt;meta name="ValidationSchema" content="http://www.w3.org/2002/08/xhtml/xhtml1-strict.xsd"/&gt;              &lt;title&gt; &lt;/title&gt;            &lt;/head&gt;            &lt;body&gt;              &lt;p&gt;   NEW YORK -- Bob Woodward, The Washington Post journalist, is headed for the best-seller list again with his revelations about "Deep Throat," the man who helped him unwind the Watergate scandal more than three decades ago. But the publishing world's interest in a book by Deep Throat himself may be waning because of a failing memory.&lt;/p&gt;              &lt;p&gt;   Woodward was not among the 1,000 authors at BookExpo America, the trade show for publishers, booksellers and librarians, during the weekend. His book and the possibility of a deal with Deep Throat, however, took center stage after Simon &amp;amp; Schuster announced that it was rushing 800,000 copies of Woodward's The Secret Man  into print in about a month.&lt;/p&gt;              &lt;p&gt;   Barnes &amp;amp; Noble vice president Bob Weitrak says the 288-page Secret will "no doubt be an instant No. 1 best seller."&lt;/p&gt;              &lt;p&gt;   Soon after Vanity Fair magazine revealed last week that W. Mark Felt was Deep Throat, the 91-year-old former FBI official talked about cashing in with his own book.&lt;/p&gt;              &lt;p&gt;   But Woodward, who has written a string of best sellers, was way ahead of him, preparing a manuscript for some time that he planned to publish when Deep Throat died. The magazine article, written by Felt's lawyer, changed that.&lt;/p&gt;              &lt;p&gt;   Vanity Fair also reported that Felt's memory had deteriorated, which could put the damper on a lucrative book deal.&lt;/p&gt;              &lt;p&gt;   Judith Regan, publisher of ReganBooks, a division of HarperCollins, revealed that 18 months ago, Felt worked with Jess Walter, a ghostwriter and novelist, but that the 20 hours of taped interviews are filled with contradictions.&lt;/p&gt;              &lt;p&gt;   "He'd say he was Deep Throat, and then 15 minutes later, he'd say he wasn't," Regan says. "Without Woodward, we couldn't confirm it." She says Felt "doesn't have much of a memory left, and any book would have to be cobbled together."&lt;/p&gt;              &lt;p&gt;   After meeting with Felt's representatives, Jamie Raab, Warner Books publisher, would say only that "we're considering it" but didn't appear enthusiastic.&lt;/p&gt;              &lt;p&gt;   Little, Brown editor in chief Geoff Shandler, who plans to meet with Felt's agent this week, says "there's reason to be wary," but "someone will publish it, figuring if you get just a fraction of Woodward's readers, that could be good enough."&lt;/p&gt;              &lt;p&gt;   Others question the marketing of Deep Throat. "They (Felt and his family) should have held off for a book first, then gone to Vanity Fair," says literary agent Michael Broussard.&lt;/p&gt;              &lt;p&gt;   Also from BookExpo: Three of William Faulkner's novels, As I Lay Dying, The Sound and the Fury and Light in August, were named as the summer's reading for Oprah Winfrey's influential TV book club.&lt;/p&gt;              &lt;p&gt;   Faulkner's publisher, Vintage, printed 600,000 copies of a $29.95 three-book box set with the Oprah's Book Club logo. At Book-Expo, Vintage celebrated by serving Mississippi mud pie, lemonade and bourbon.&lt;/p&gt;            &lt;/body&gt;          &lt;/html&gt;</Text>
