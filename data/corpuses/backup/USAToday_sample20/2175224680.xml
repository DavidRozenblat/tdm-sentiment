&lt;p width="0" align="left"&gt;PARK CITY, Utah – For Awkwafina, going to Sundance was a major example of "expectations vs. reality."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I thought it'd be like, 'I'm wearing ski attire, I'm going to see all these movies,'" says the actress/rapper, whose new films "The Farewell" and "Paradise Hills" premiered at the mountainside festival. Instead, she was red carpet-ready the whole weekend and watched nothing else: "It was so much fun, though." &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The wisecracking Queens, New York, native (real name: Nora Lum) is having her breakthrough moment, with scene-stealing roles in last summer's "Ocean's8" and "Crazy Rich Asians." But her playful yet poignant turn in "Farewell" could propel her to the A-list. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Filmmaker Lulu Wang's bittersweet drama follows a capricious Chinese-American woman named Billi (Awkwafina), who travels back to China for her cousin's wedding. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But she quickly finds out the ceremony is really just an excuse for her family to gather and say goodbye to their ailing grandmother (Zhao Shuzhen), who is blissfully unaware that she only has months to live. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Farewell," which is subtitled in English, has been picked up by A24 for theatrical distribution later this year. Awkwafina, 29,  chats with USA TODAY about the highly personal project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Question: "The Farewell" is a huge departure for you, in that it's a drama and mostly in Chinese. Were you hesitant about taking this on?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Awkwafina:&lt;/i&gt; There was absolutely no hesitation – I had never read anything like it. It speaks to me very personally, because I have this relationship with my grandmother who raised me when my mom passed. But I think it's also personal for a lot of people. There were so many people coming up to us hours after (the premiere), just holding back tears and saying they had been through very similar things. It means a lot to people, so that's really cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Q: How was your Mandarin going into this?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Awkwafina:&lt;/i&gt; Not good! It was like struggle city. That was one of the things I was really insecure about, just never speaking it at home. My grandma spoke mostly English to me (growing up). So I moved to China and took classes, and my grandma kind of helped me, too. But we also changed the character so Billi doesn't know Chinese all that well. (Laughs.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Q: When it comes to food porn, "Farewell" certainly gives "Crazy Rich Asians" a run for its money. What do you remember about shooting all those family dinner scenes?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Awkwafina:&lt;/i&gt; I mean, when you go to China, the food is nothing like what you see here. They don't do a General Tso's over there, so it's just real hometown cuisine. That specific area really specializes in a couple dishes: one is like this pork or beef marinated in cinnamon, which was amazing. I gained like 50 pounds, it was constant eating. But "Crazy Rich Asians" had really good food, too. Hungry movies!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Q: What's it going to be like watching this with your grandma? I imagine it could be pretty emotional.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Awkwafina:&lt;/i&gt; I can't wait for her to see it. I just want her to see that I can speak Chinese! She (usually) drags my Chinese. (Laughs.) But I think it's going to be one of the only movies that I'll do that my grandma will understand. For me to show her something that I'm proud of and she gets is very, very special to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Q: Many people were disappointed that "Crazy Rich Asians" was passed over by the Oscars last week. What was your reaction?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Awkwafina:&lt;/i&gt; I don't think there's any really hard feelings from me or the cast. We had an amazing awards run. The fact that we were able to do that and win best picture at the Critics' Choice Awards, that was awesome. So the fact that it was even recognized (there) is enough. I don't think any of us are "mad" – that's just how it goes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</Text>
