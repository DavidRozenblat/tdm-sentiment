"Last series was a bad matchup series [for him].&lt;/p&gt;              &lt;p&gt;   "This can be a series where it's a building block not only for us and for him in the playoffs, but for him as far as next season."&lt;/p&gt;              &lt;p&gt;   Said Olowokandi, who averaged 6.5 points and 5.7 rebounds in 43 regular-season games: "Whenever you feel needed, it's a good thing. Even though I wasn't playing in the last series, it was in the back of my mind to prepare myself and get ready and I think I'm definitely up to the challenge."&lt;/p&gt;              &lt;p&gt;   *&lt;/p&gt;              &lt;p&gt;   Because of recurring back spasms, Sam Cassell wasn't expected to be much more than a decoy in Wednesday's Game 7 victory over the Kings.&lt;/p&gt;              &lt;p&gt;   Instead, he scored 23 points, 11 in the first quarter, to help the Timberwolves to a big early lead and two on free throws with 16.2 seconds to play, the final points in an 83-80 victory. He played 38 minutes, making 10 of 11 free throws.&lt;/p&gt;              &lt;p&gt;   "He showed the type of heart he had," Saunders said. "A lot of guys would not have been able to play. They wouldn't have been able to play at the level that he did. He just said, 'I'm going to give everything I have.' That's why I was afraid to take him out. I was afraid once I took him out he might not be able to go back in."&lt;/p&gt;              &lt;p&gt;   Though he's hurting, Cassell is not expected to sit out now.&lt;/p&gt;              &lt;p&gt;   "We'll be able to get him enough rest between games, get him enough treatment that he'll be able to keep on playing for us," Saunders said.&lt;/p&gt;              &lt;p&gt;   *&lt;/p&gt;              &lt;p&gt;   Kevin McHale, the Timberwolves' general manager, on the Lakers' aura: "Auras don't win basketball games.
